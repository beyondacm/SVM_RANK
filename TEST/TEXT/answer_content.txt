235,reglan+tylenol! 10 mg of metoclopramide (reglan) taken with 1  000 mg of acetamoniphen (tylenol) at the onset of migraine-type headache aborts the painful episode in the majority of cases as well as tryptans at a small fraction of the cost and with no known pregnancy effects (i e safe throughout pregnancy) do not take more than 2-3 times in a day and discuss with your obstetrician if that could work for you!

270,need mamogram/ultra this can be a number of things breast pain is not a common presenting symptom of breast cancer  but can occur breast pain during menses is common due to enlargement of the breast ducts during the estrogen surge i would have a mammogram or ultrasound if you have a painful lump  although this is usually due to fibrocystic disease
271,unlikely enlarged lymph nodes can be due to cancer but in that case they typically are painless infection related enlargement of nodes is often tender if the nodes do not settle down in 2-3 weeks  you should get checked by your primary care doctor

278,depends ask your doctor how dilated the bile duct is after gallbladder removal  it is normal to have a slightly enlarged bile duct additionally  as you age  your bile duct usually enlarges a bit  usually about 1 mm per 10 years if you have stones in your bile duct  you certainly need to have this addressed finally  proving that your pain is from the dilated bile duct is quite difficult
279,important info the mammogram (mg) and ultrasound(us) show breast tissue in different ways the mg is better for women with fatty breasts the us can help tell if a mass is solid or cystic (fluid filled) it can also give a better picture for women who have dense breasts the tests are often used together to help determine what is going on

282,possibly if you had the diagnostic mammogram for something you can feel  like a lump  then you will almost certainly need an ultrasound if you were called back for calcifcations  you most likely will not need an ultrasound if a mass was seen on the mammogram  that you cannot feel  you will also need an ultrasound

285,consult orthopedics this sounds like a complicated orthopedic surgery problem you should consult an orthopedic surgeon the swelling and symptoms you describe are certainly not normal and suggest a major joint problem exam  x-rays  and mri will likely be needed treatments could include therapy  bracing  anti-inflammatory meds  injections  and possibly surgery you should not let this persist
286,agree with dr garber if you are on  or just finished your period  urine will show blood blood means red cells  without white cells uti ( infection) is much less likely need to recheck urine to make sure blood is not still there if still  with protein  need a nephrologist  if blood without protein in urine  need a urologist
287,not known 4 sure coxsackie virus can be transmitted by nasal  salivary discharges  as well as by the blister-like rash that may appear  and by stool (poop) so even when the rash disappears  the virus can still be shed in the poop for weeks wash hands well!
288,not usually perm lesion can mean many things-in this case  it refers to the location of what is causing your problem the ulnar nerve has several functions with one being sensation to the 4th and 5th fingers so numbness and tingling suggests the ulnar nerve is irritated  confirmed by the emg most common is from pressure at the funny bone where the ulnar nerve travelsoften stopping pressure cures it
289,sound vs xrays mammograms use xrays to image the breast tissue screening mmgs involve 2 views (mlo  cc) of each whole breast ultrasound uses sound waves to produce images of the breast tissue the area visualized is dependent upon where the probe is placed on the breast and is influenced by how it is angled  how fast it is moved around and how much attention is being paid to the screen during the exam
290,panic attack? the symptoms you had  can occur with a panic attack  some panic attacks seem to come out of the blue  but others may have environmental triggers it would also be important to know whether any physical violence was happening in this fighting you & your husband might benefit from couple's counseling so that disagreements don't get to this point -- and it may help you to see your doctor too
291,melatonin possible but not likely  if it was working when taken regularly
292,stiff pip 1 arthritis is a common cause of stiffness of these joints 2 often a trigger finger will give the feeling that this joint is sore and stiff 3 often the two problems arise in the same finger each exacerbating the other
293,more commonly viral viral infections are much more common and likely causing your symptom complex  but it is difficult to tell for sure if your throat is red  with pus  and swollen  you should have it checked for possible strepthroat otherwise  viral is likely and symptoms will get better in a few days motrin/tylenol  and sorethroat spray to help your symptoms consult doc if you get worse good luck
294,uncommon  age if the partial knee replacement is performed correctly  one should expect it to last for many years at the age of 38  you still need to avoid running for excercise  just as for a full knee replacement if indicated  much better option for you at your very young age
295,see your doctor please contact your physician immediately regarding this condition this could be related to your epidural or an injury to your sciatic nerve
296,trigger fingers? sounds like trigger fingers the inflammation should first be treated and if this fails to resolve the condition  further evaluation may be warranted with possible surgery
297,early am stiffness a common problem for joint issues in the hand no matter what the cause the important thing is make sure that you work out the stiffness each and every day warm soaks warm showers and exercises such as the classic hand six pack exercises especially working on making a full fist and working on flexing the joints fully remember warm to warm up at the beginning of the day and ice after activity
298,loss of urine stress incontinence is losing urine without meaning to during physical activity  such as coughing  sneezing  laughing  or exercise stress incontinence may occur from weakened pelvic muscles that support the bladder and urethra or because the urethral sphincter is not working correctly this could be caused by: childbirth  medications  obesity  smoking stress incont is much more common in women
299,if you have had a blood draw or iv injection  a sclerosed vein the u/s can tell characteristics of the lump  solid  cystic or fluid filled need to check other nodes list medsdrug reaction only biopsy can discern what is in a node
300,several ways some of this depends on what part of the leg is affected and the underlying cause treatments include medicine  injection therapy  pt  spinal cord stimulation and further surgery
301,sore throat you may have any number of problems  including infected wisdom teeth  periodontal (gum and bone) disease  or other soft tissue infection(s) advanced tooth decay and abscess could cause pain and this much local soft tissue inflammation but the other conditions are equally important to identify and treat see a dentist or oral surgeon immediately
302,i don't think so i would have it checked out by a doctor
303,yes there are many causes for missing a period in addition to pregnancy common causes are stress  heavy exercise  weight changes  travel  thyroid problems or other hormone changes if you are worried about pregnancy  and the first test is negative  repeat it in a few days
304,it can be this is most likely a stitch dissolving and coming out to the surface you need to see your surgeon it may require some short term antibiotics
305,yes it means the origin of the tumor is from the breast it is a primary breast cancer that has spread or metastasized to the lung
306,sometimes there are lesions that can be determined with a high level of assurance to be benign and lesions that can be determined to be malignant  there are also many lesions that cannot be determined with a high degree of certainty with these sstudies alone
307,normal all pregnancies are different not all women have the same symptoms so do t worry about the breast tenderness at 10 wks your uterus is still i side the pelvis at 20 wks your uterus will be at the belly bottom and you will start feeling movement
308,leak w/pressure stress incontinence is due to a combination of weak ligaments and weak pelvic muscles commonly associated w/weakness caused by vaginal childbirth but can occur in women who've not given birth the most common treatments are kegels or pelvic muscle exercise muscles can be too weak to exercise on your own; pelvic floor pt is the best method minimally invasive surgery can restore ligament support
309,call ob gyn the on call doctor will answer you question
310,depends could be either seizures frequently have loss of conciousness  and no pain; but panic attacks do not usually have headache  either see a doctor
311,ice and elevate sounds like this is a reaction to the sting i'd recommend ice  elevating your foot  using nsaids (like ibuprofen)  and benadryl
312,maybe it is possibe that this could still be benign  it sounds like the docs are checking up on an abnormal mammogram finding if it was highly suspicious  you would have already have had a biopsy hopefully you will get the results soon - get a biopsy if needed  or hopefully  be reassured that it looks ok and have appropriate follow-up scheduled
313,allergies it sounds like you have allergic rhinitis  not a virus you should take allergy medicine  like claritin  allegra or zyrtec  with the decongestant if you don't have high blood pressure or see your doctor about a nasal steroid spray
314,check with your doc a mammogram is a screening tool & an ultrasound and magnified views of a breast area would have given the radiologist more information if no concerning areas are found  your doc has to correlate your risk factors with your clinical exam to decide if a repeat in 6 months is appropriate do this first & if still concerned  then feel free to seek a second opinion take good care of yourself
315,yes for purposes of dental insurance  any thing done to enhance the smile in absence of decay or fracture is considered cosmetic and usually not covered the only exception would be if you have orthodontic coverage
316,sounds like sciatica this sounds like a typical case of a sciatica or pain radiating into the leg due to a nerve compression that can be due to a disc herniation usually but there can be other explanations generally this is true with pain that goes past the knee and can be confirmed on exam and by imaging with a ct scan or mri most get better without surgery
317,anxiety start meditation & relaxation with imagery  by closing your eyes & visualizing going thru the visit practice breathing exercises keep in mind also that most of us have similar anxiety since we are not sure what the doctor is going to tell us  or if we will hear bad news seeing a therapist for cognitive behavior therapy does help as well
318,call your doctor if this is really purely due to the radiation pneumonitis  prednisone may help (as outpatient) you would want to be sure there is no concomitant infection or any other problem your doctor should be able to help you with this
319,moles and cancer moles & melanoma  one form of skin cancer  come from same cells in skin  melanocytes  that make a pigment (melanin) that gives skin its tan/brown pigmentation melanocytes are also in the eye  inner ear & heart moles are benign collections of melanocytes some moles  like large congenital moles can develop melanoma most melanomas develop on normal skin any changing mole needs to be examined
320,sleep on your side if you are a mild snorer  sleeping on your side may be all you need to do a bumper belt can help if your snoring is more vigorous  you may have sleep apnea you need to see your doctor who can order a sleep study if you have sleep apnea options usually include a cpap  surgery or a special dental appliance a dental appliance should only be provided by a dentist trained in dental sleep medicine
321,yes and no pelvic prolapse and urinary incontinence are two distinct entities that often occur together in some circumstances pelvic prolapse reduces urinary incontinence due to increased urethral pressures surgeons often discuss issues of future incontinence when treating prolapse a complete pelvic floor evaluation is important when planning surgery to avoid these issues
322,tmj pain around th ear and the jaw following tonsillectomy is probably a result of keeping the mouth wide open for a long time during the surgery which puts lots of strain on the temptomsndibular joint (tmj) and the muscles that are involved with this joint talk to your dentist there are exercises that you can do to ease the pain there are also muscle relaxing and pain med you can take
323,bad breath see your ent for post nasal drip meanwhile use a tongue scraper to clean your tongue few times per day because the bacterial can sit and harbor on top of your tongue perpetuating the bad breath
324,damaged muscles childbirth can be traumatic to the muscles and nerves surrounding the bladder  vagina and rectum the nerves can be damaged and small tears in the muscles can lead to prolapse and incontinence is some women it's nothing to be embarrassed about it is common and fixable
325,not your heart those tests have pretty much ruled out your heart as the cause of your symptoms
326,sounds like prolapse considering your history and the symptoms that you describe you probably do have some type of prolapse many women can feel something bulging through the vaginal opening to check  place fingers at the vaginal opening while seated on a toilet and bear down as if you are trying to have a bowel movement your doctor could determine exactly what parts are dropping and discuss treatment options
327,remember the moa as an aside  it's important to remember how these meds work your allergies are caused by histamine release in the body antihistamines block the release of histamine  not its effects its important therefore to take allergy medicine prior to experiencing the allergy symptoms antihistamines are to prevent allergy symptoms  not get rid of them once they've already shown up
328,maybe both but usually when sinuses get infected the upper teeth become sore  the infection in the sinus can creat pressure which can push against the root of the teeth hence the sensitivity and soreness the rest of your question i hope an md can answer! hope you feel better soon!
329,yes  secondarily a strong exposure to an airborne allergen can cause drainage which when snorting  mouth breathing  throat clearing  then cause throat soreness i have personally had heavy exposure to dust mite (a borrowed pillow) and woke up the next morning with a raw throat
330,musculoskeletal pain most probably musculoskeletal pain however this needs full evaluation with your doctor  if pain persists
331,cannot fairly answer need to know other meds!
332,3 or more the rule of thumb i follow is no more than 3 injections in a one year period into the same area and at least 1 month between injections this may be more or less conservative when compared to other docs but it has kept my complication rate very low corticosteroids over time can weaken or rupture tendons/ ligaments and cause necrosis in bone if your not responding  ask about other treatments
333,need to see doctor only way to find three issues you have is by seeing your doctor you have skin cancer before head lesion could be a skin cancer   'you are weak fatigued  bruise super eaisily ' is also a concern need professional attention and need tests

335,copd? sounds like your cancer is cured  congratulations  you are one of few! you probably smoked and this lingering bronchitis may be uncontrolled copd check with your doctor for bronchodilators +/- steroids radiation pneumonitis would be very unusual after all this time
336,yes in fact  this is fairly common no one knows where spitz nevus leaves off and a melanoma capable of metastasizing begins this is one of the hardest calls in pathology  and some say it's impossible the burning question will be whether to do additional surgery
337,hair before coloring  consult a dermatologist
338,not sure you should not have root canal therapy unless there is a definitive diagnosis and the specific tooth can be identified you may have atypical facial pain and i would suggest seeing someone who specializes or has extensive experience in treating oral-facial pain disorders
339,yes it can the answer is yes it can it can spread to other areas of your body but also  it is possible to be a second primary ( a second melanoma that is not a spread from the 1st melanoma) in any case  you should talk to your md/ dermatologist about this -have it checked and treated -asap
340,barrier methods iud  condoms  diaphragm  spermicide  vasectomy will have little to no systemic side effects
341,depends once a diagnosis has been made  and anticoagulants(blood thinners) have been started and the patient's condition is stable   the md may recommend ambulation (walking) and compression stockings to prevent other clots the stockings are graduated in pressure starting at the ankle the md most familiar with you current condition should be consulted on thigh high or knee high hose
342,several months after starting warfarin the blood clot can no longer grow the body will start to break down the clot within days it takes months to have the clot reabsorbed or for the process to make an opening through the clot so blood can get through again swelling will be visibly less in a few weeks but it could be 6 months before the leg is back to normal occasionally  the swelling persists indefinitely
343,mammogram mammograms are generally better at screening for breast cancer ultrasound is used more for a focus evaluation of an area of the breast that might be suspicious or appear abnormal
344,mulltiple long term effects of radiation therapy for breast cancer include: radiation fibrosis of lung lymphedema of the affected side upper extremity myocardial injury hypothyroidism brachial plexus injury risk of second neoplasm (radiation induced malignancy)
345,about 6 weeks the first week you can expect some discomfort a small percentage of patients have a lot of pain its difficult to determine who they are preoperatively most surgeons want you doing a home exercise program during the 1st week you will be able to walk usually with the use of a cane for a few days at the end of the 1st week  your surgeon will remove sutures and start pt each week you will progressively improve  and usually by 6 weeks you should be 90% healed the last 10% can take several months
346,sounds more like rfx it is common for reflux to increase initially & peak @4-5m it often causes nasal congestion (noise in sleep) & choking most sleep apnea is associated with the acquisition of a significant amount of tonsil & adenoidal tissue babies have little or none while some premi babies often have apnea episodes  even they seldom do after 4m
347,a lot depends on where the break is at if it is not into a joint  there should be little worry about displacement or not  based in the information you gave from two other doctors no surgery now!
348,definitely  no amoxicyline is recommended as an adjunct to surgical management only see a dentist for examination x-rays and treatment dental and gums problems are never any fun  but the good news is that most of them can be easily prevented
349,yes  it ok to finish swollen lymph nodes in your neck and jaw is a symptom of infection it can take a long time for the infection to clear up even after the root canal is completed ask your dentist for more information
350,could be sleep apnea but you need to see a doctor the internet is a great place to answer some questions like what is sleep apnea? or what is cheyne-stokes breathing? the internet not a good place to get a diagnosis that requires obtaining a complete history  a hands-on physical exam  maybe a sleep study or echocardiogram  etc  use the internet to get the questions to bring to your doctor  not the answers
351,possible bakers cyst as well as nerve entrapment see an orthopedist
352,nerve injury no one can tell how long will this last it may be permanent  which is rare (1/10000)  most of the injuries are temporary and may resolve within 1 year
353,because  if a suspicious lesion is noted on mammography an us is obtained this allows for better definition of the lesion in the breast however  a negative us does not rule out an underlying problem and the correct next step is to proceed with your physicians recommendation  in this case a biopsy none of the imaging techniques are perfect  the final decision is based on all the information
354,see your dentist you should see a dentist to check the function of your temporomandibular joint  or jaw joint that is by your ear they can make a better diagnosis and give you treatment options
355,probably it may be related to scar tissue  or maltracking of the kneecap it should continue to improve over time and with physical therapy

360,lyme cns lyme disease can appears similar to that of ms both on imaging and in spinal fluid i recommend lumbar puncture to send for both ms panel and lyme titers some but not all physicians believe in chronicc lyme disease  but this is a different problem than cns lyme affecting the brain/spinal cord
361,mrs mohanty needs to see a doctor there are many reasons why legs can swell the concern is the fact she has pain many people with swollen legs do not complain of pain rather tired legs  a heaviness etc due to t he fact there is pain this should be checked out as you stated the swelling itself appears to have been there a while
362,probably not the general principle is chemotherapy is trying to inflict damage on cells ask your oncologisttherefore probably best to avoid supplements
363,not likely a stenosis of the carotid arteries as in any other artery is a process that takes years to develop and is referred to as plaque plaque that has developed in the artery does not go away on its own it can be removed reliably and safely with endarterectomy of the carotid artery massaging the carotid arteries will likely not help the situation and may dislodge unstable plaque making it dangerous
364,show your derm if your dermatologist did not do a full body check  and you are concerned  let them know
365,a number of processes can cause what is happening to you some are related to infection  some to other issues you should see your doctor hope things are ok

368,allergy to seafood you may have an allergy to seafood avoid seafood in the future talk to your doctor about this allergy testing may be helpful in finding out exactly what is causing the problem
369,choose who you trust ultimately  you must choose the surgeon you trust i'm not sure what a lower degree vs a superior degree we all have one degree - md/do others  like myself  have certification from the american board of surgery and are fellows of the american college of surgeons all indicating that we have passed a number of milestones in training  ethical conduct and continued verification processes
370,scalpel by denitsr the method of draining an abscess depends greatly on the location of the abscess some can not be reached to drain typically  an oral surgeon or a general dentist can drain near surface abscess with a scalpel and place a drain to ensure it drains completely i would not attempt to do it yourself since there are anatomical considerations that make may make that dangerous
371,inner ear issue? inner ear is balance organ  often affected by sinus infection often positional vertigo  nausea  vomiting call your doc
372,a hernia if the swelling disappears when you lie down and massage it  it may be a hernia may require simple surgery if painful if not need to be evaluated by your doctor
373,see your doctor this problem can only be solved by seeing your doctor and being evaluated face-to-face after a thorough examination  your doctor should be able to tell you what's wrong and what to do about it
374,endoscopic or open? it depends if you had the traditional open decompression  then that is normal on average  it takes 3 to 6 months to fully heal if you had it done endoscopically like i do it  with no incision on the hand  then most are fully back to work without restrictions within a few days  and fully healed in a few weeks so in short  it depends mostly on who did your surgery  and how it was done
375,after healing we like to do a post op check up at about 2 weeks after surgery before feeling safe about travel
376,gallbladder dz approximately 30% of gallstones are not visible on ct sludge is better seen on us and gallbladder inflammation can sometimes be better seen on us
377,check there is no way to know without testing similar odors may be caused by bacterial vaginosis and trichomonas generally though trichomonas will cause itching bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance of the vaginal bacteria your excessive hygiene practices may be worsening the problem use of hygiene products such as bubble bath  vaginal spray or vaginal deodorant can increase the risk
378,many possibilities numbness can occur from various reasons some potential causes include vitamin deficiency  nerve damage  nerve compression  and alcohol over consumption  side effects of different medications  or as a result of different systemic medical conditions such as diabetes get evaluated by a professional to determine the diagnosis treatment is based on the diagnosis
379,probably not i am assuming the wisdom tooth cavity is deep if not the wisdom tooth should not be causing any pain from the cavity the two are not related but a person can feel like the pain is coming from the same area a dentist should be able to differentiate the two
380,cranberry concentra cranberry concentrate without sugar or splenda otc product with urinary antiseptic which colors urine orange for 3 to 4 days copious amounts of water
381,yes! absolutely! especially the lower ones see your dentist to determine if this may be the cause of your vertigo

384,74% is normal hida scan with cck augmentation normal range is typically greater than 50%  with 35% to 50% being borderline and less than 35% being abnormal the gallbladder should contract with cck (an analog of a hormone that causes gallbladder emptying) if it is responding/working normally the hida portion examines the liver cells that make bile and the bile ducts to make sure they are not blocked
385,yes! certainly a real possibility i would test again in a few days  or better yetsome folks say that a serum hcg ( blood pregnancy test) is more sensitivetry that ( in my experience  the urine tests we do in my office are usually pretty reliable too) hope this helps dr p
386,see a doctor see a doctor that specializes in head  neck and mouth pain a lot of these symptoms can be explained by tension of the muscles in the neck  temporal area  and jaw muscles this type a doctor can identify and treat the problem areas accordingly
387,absolutely saline irrigation of the nose is safe and effective i encourage all my nasal allergy patients to rinse their nose there are also non=allergic forms of nasal disease as well as chronic sinusitis  where nasal irrigation is crucial
388,no no danger
389,see your doctor this can be as simple as the flu or something much more ominous see your doctor
390,no there are 3 mainstream modalities of breast imaging - mammogram  ultrasound and breast mri each of these has its strengths and weaknesses mammogram is used as a screening tool for all women in the us because it gives the best overall picture the ultrasound is most commonly used to help discern between a cyst and a solid lesion
391,it's possible you could try that route generally speaking  only those who modify their activities  may be able to function fairly well with a torn acl at your age  you should probably have it surgically repaired
392,see your surgeon as an artifical device some clicking can be normal  especially in certain designs new onset of clicking or popping can be a sign of laxity or patella clunk syndrome patella cluck syndrome occurs when scar tissue develops around the patella and gets caught between the patella and femoral components when the knee flexes it is not harmful but can be annoying and removed with surgery
393,no chondromalacia means that the articular cartialge has been damaged most commonly this is involves the patella and is treated nonsurgically with therapy persistent pain may be an indication for surgery there are many procedures for this  including realignment and/or a cartilage restoration procedure  like debridement  drilling  microfracture  osteochondral transplant  or carticel(r) graft
394,depends it would be great if the answer was a definitive yes and  though the way you describe it  it seems likely  but it depends on the type of cancer  the extent of involvement  and the size of metastases also  if there are obscuring findings  like a diffuse pneumonia  it might be difficult to pick up on x-ray
395,push fluids increasing fluids and cranberry may help ideally you should see your pcp or go to an urgent care
396,all all of these can be symptoms of cardiology  and diabetes dramatically increases the risk of cardiology chest pain  shortness of breath  and associated dizziness can all be symptoms of angina  which is caused by narrowing or blockages in the coronary arteries angina might also be accompanied by excessive sweating  nausea  or fatigue cold finger tips may be a symptom of poor circulation to the hands  which can be caused by atherosclerosis in the peripheral arties or also by diabetic nerve disease if you have these symptoms  whether or not you have diabetes  you should definitely see your doctor for further evaluation
397,no  no  breast size generally does not affect the sensitivity of the mammogram breast density on the other hand  can affect the sensitivity of mammography breasts are made up of both fat and glandular tissue if the breasts are mostly fatty  it is easier to detect a small tumor breasts that have a high percentage of glandular tissue and are very dense can easily hide small tumors breast implants can also make mammogram evaluation more difficult; for this reason  additional views are obtained on women who have breast implants (displaced implant views)
398,currently  currently  at our institution we recommend that a woman with no risk factors begin yearly screening mammography at age 40 however  the recommendation for beginning screening mammography has become more controversial due to the recently published recommendations by the us preventative services task force which recommends screening mammography for women age 50 to 74 years a rationale behind this recommendation is that screening mammography in women age 40 - 49 years results in more false positive results with comparatively few cancers detected currently  both the american college of radiology and the american cancer society recommend yearly screening beginning at 40 years of age
399,similiar interstitial lung disease is an umbrella term for many diseases; one of these disease is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or ipf
400,depends every ent doctor has a different answer some let people eat real food right away i tell my patients to avoid foods and drinks that are hot  hard  spicy or acidic for 2 weeks i like my patients to stay away from anything that can scratch  burn or irritate their throats while healing no chips  fries  tomatoes  coffee  tea  lemon orange etc best for you to ask your doctor his/her preference
401,see your doctor if your doctor is treating you for the warts and you've had irritants put on your feet it the past few days  your feet will likely blister and hurt if you're concerned about the look of the reaction  best to go back to your doctor if you have an infection  they'll prescribed you an antibiotic
402,needle biopsy first both doctors are right it is recommended to do a needle biopsy first many times if it is benign additional surgery can be avoided certain benign lesions may require excision to rule out associated malignancy i suspect that was the case of your sister if the needle biopsy showed cancer  then a definitive cancer surgery can be done
403,there there are different types of needle biopsies - depending on the size of the needle used a fine needle aspiration uses a small needle to extract fluid or a few cells while a core needle biopsy actually removes a small piece of tissue the size of the core can vary from very small to about 25 mm in diameter
404,no  symptoms; ↑ds angioplasty: hydraulic expansion of narrowing; damages artery & can easily recur: reason for stents & procedure further complicates the disease process there has long been evidence that arterial disease is at least partially reversible  but mds paid for treating symptoms optimize nmr particle test ldl ?700 nmol/l  large hdl ?9 µmol/l)  hba1c ?60%  50% optimal  sbp ?120  ?body fat  ?activity
405,you you may have already tried not drinking caffeine after noon  not exercising too close to bedtime  and not using your computer or tv within an hour of bedtime consider adding white noise such as a fan be sure that your room is cool and not overly warm eating light during the day  then having a larger meal at around 7 pm or so can be helpful some conditions such as depression can cause early morning awakening  so if you have any symptoms of depression please tell your doctor if your sleep problems are ongoing  you may need a different type of sleep medication at your doctor's recommendation
406,yes large local reactions are a bit more worrisome say u r stung on the ankle  if the swelling goes up to the hip then the person really should see an allergist for testing especially since most people almost never know what stung them it is important  though  to wait 6 weeks after this sting for testing
407,cold or flu cold or flu would be the most likely answer it worsens or continues  see an md good luck
408,while while no physician can evaluate your mole without seeing it  the following clues (the abcde mnemonic) will help you determine if you should see your doctor: asymmetry: if you draw an imaginary line through the middle of your mole  both halves should look about the same moles that are asymmetric (unequal) are more likely to be cancerous border: most benign moles have smooth  distinct borders those that have uneven  hazy  or indistinct borders are more likely to be cancerous color: benign moles usually have a uniform pink  brown  or yellow color those with several shades of brown  black  blue  or red  or those that are jet black or blue-black are more worrisome diameter: most benign moles are smaller in diameter than a standard pencil eraser evolution: any mole that bleeds  changes color or shape  itches  or otherwise causes concern should be evaluated by your physician hope that helps!
409,facelift ; kidney i would think that your history of swelling elsewhere would certainly also apply to your face following facelift surgery it however is not an independent contraindication for surgery - just that it will take a bit longer for recovery
410,should be fine base your activity level on your discomfort level you should be fine if it doesn't bother you at some point however  you should see a general surgeon with experience in both open and laparoscopic hernia repair as we think that hernias are riskier to leave alone in women compared to men
411,er asap go to er immediately  lupus and high bp can cause visual problems both can affect brain function
412,not necessarily a deep plane facelift may be less at risk for sensory changes consult a specialist in facelifting for a detailed consultation wwwasc-psdcom
413,get workup the most concerning is the narrow stools and blood this could be rectal cancer you need a colonoscopy
414,probably the nail is considered dirty if it actually breaks the skin you usually get an infection this can become an abscess if not treated there may also be a spicule present under the skin that you can not see or get to see a podiatrist
415,you and your oncolog you and your oncologist need to discuss this given the low stage  and assuming successful completion of treatment  pet/ct might not be indicated at this time it does depend on the specifics of your case pet/ct is useful in evaluating for distal metastatic disease it does not replace mammography  ultrasound or breast mri for local recurrence surveillance
416,get checked if you have headaches in the mornings or headaches that wake you up from sleep  you should get checked out by a neurologist
417,this this type of swelling occurs in the clear covering over the white part of the eye this clear layer is called the conjunctiva  and it has cells that produce tears  mucous and oils to keep the surface of the eye moist when these cells get over-stimulated  they can over-produce fluids  and this fluid can get trapped between the conjunctiva and the sclera (the white layer)  so a bubble forms usually  this bubble will go away as you get better  but if it is irritating  or if it lasts longer  you should see an ophthalmologist (optometrists are not medical doctors  and most cannot prescribe medications) who can prescribe an anti-allergy drop such as patanol  pataday or bepreve i often find that this is not sufficient  and a short course of steroid eye drops works better these must be used with care  under the guidance of your doctor one last note  please don't press on that bubble  or put anything else in your eye! this can make it more irritated  or cause other problems
418,get evaluated see a sports medicine physician  who will start with xrays an ac sprain can be diagnosed with xray and an exam if it's something else  an mri may be necessary
419,probably if antihistamine up to 4 times the usual daily dose does not help  see a doctor because itching is more miserable than pain and cannot be ignored
420,there there is probably no way for the nurse to be sure of the diagnosis this could be anything from an allergic conjunctivitis to something bacterial if not better in the next 24 hours  i would see an ophthalmologist for diagnosis and treatment
421,arrhythmia mitral valve prolapse is typically asymptomatic by itself but can be associated with some abnormal heart rhythms which can be symptomatic
422,i i agree  as long as you have an otherwise healthy scalp with good circulation and no growths or significant sun damage that would make the grafts not take it is also important to have a good consultation to determine your options  to discuss your goals  and pricing
423,even even though it is very rare (only 19 cases reported as of 2009)  it is possible to have a c difficile infection without a colon i attached the abstract of the paper that describes it below i hope your fiance is feeling better soon!
424,stain of some sort your dentist has given a clean bill of health regarding your teeth i suspect what you are seeing is either a stain or ebernated enamel ebernated enamel is affected enamel  the outer covering of the tooth has had repeated acid attacks from bacteria interspersed with healing periods (possibly fluoride as well) and it heals up they are usually seen between the teeth as opposed to on top
425,typically typically ingrown toe nails cause a localized infection of the skin surrounding the nail (cellulitis) which could eventually lead to an abscess if left untreated what you described sounds more like cellulitis the treatment for this is antibiotics the treatment for an abscess is the same  however in some case it may need to be opened and drained if your primary care doctor is not treating your problem then you should ask for a referral to a podiatrist (foot doctor) you also probably need the ingrown toe nail to be surgically removed best of luck
426,yes no matter what treatment  cancer of the breast does not have 100 % results so with lumpectomy and radiation cancer can still recurr this is why patients need to follow with all their doctors for exams and x-rays if there is a recurrence other options exist such as mastectomy
427,usually not breast cancer that has come back in the lung usually requires chemotherapy it depends on the type of breast cancer  how quickly it is growing  and whether there are multiple spots or just one spot breast cancer in the lung means microscopic cancer has spread through the body  so a whole-body treatment like chemo (or hormone-blocking therapy) is necessary for best results
428,hard to say one white spot on brain mri is nonspecific if it is in a particular area (corpus callosum) it would be more concerning  otherwise it could have been from prior brain infection (encephalitis) or trauma (shearing injury) your symptoms are a bit more worrisome perhaps a spinal fluid analysis will help neurology consult would be useful
429,everyone's everyone's body reacts differently  however most people have significant discomfort/pain for about 2 days  then begin to improve i have seen some patients be quite painful for a week be sure to use the medications as prescribed for pain and you will most likely do well
430,maybe antibiotics help to control a dental infection  but rarely eliminate the source of it a procedure (extraction or root canal) is usually needed to accomplish a cure antibiotics can buy some time  but should not be used on a continuing basis
431,yes impacted 3rd molars very often work their way into the mouth  and many just stay put without a special image called a panoramic or panorex  the dentist has no way of assessing the condition of the roots many times there exist pathologies adjacent to and because of these teeth  with no symptoms at all waiting until you feel pain is too late in my opinion  and would be supervised neglect
432,yes new chemotherapy agents have been introduced there are also newer types of rmachines and techniques however in regards to radiation if you had the same exact problem now versus 13 years ago the treatment might be exactly the same
433,many possible dx there are several possibilities as outlined by the physicians who answered the question in addition  i would add insect bites it would be helpful if you could upload a picture of the rash
434,retreatment vs apico both retreatment and apicoectomy have their place in dentistry i prefer retreatment as a primary next step because it is a more conservative treatment and can be quite successful this is not a discredit to apicoectomy though your case will be unique and should be evaluated by a competent endodontist the use of cbct 3-d imaging will help with the decision-making the os will say extract
435,no the risk to the transplanted lungs are infection from bacteria left over from the old lungs  and acute and chronic rejection of the new lung by the body cystic fibrosis is a defect that is limited to the old lungs
436,varies uncomplicated removal of breast implants may take 15 to 20 min however  if removal of the surrounding breast implant capsule is also performed  surgery may take 1 to 15 hours if the surrounding breast implant capsule has thickened/calcified and/or is symptomatic  patients may benefit from this additional procedure (capsulectomy)
437,see a dentist you have an infection it needs to be treated popping can relieve some of the pressure that you feel but it will not cure the infection please see a dentist and get this treated without treatment things will progress and get worse you may not have so much pain because there can be drainage  but the infection is still there it can effect the rest of your body
438,dr dr wolfe provided excellent information when pressure does not equalize appropriately between the outside of the body and the inside; it can cause squeezes and reverse squeezes bleeding into the ear or into a sinus can actually improve pain as it helps to equilibrate but noone wants to have a pressure - related injury i used to be a diving medicine doctor - so we say lots of these types of problems this is a technique that can be helpful when you are having difficulty equilibrating pressure on airplane ascent or decent place folded paper towels on the bottom of two cups (ie like a sytrofoam cup) poor warm to hot (not boiling) water onto the paper towels hold the cup/ cups over the ear or ears (against your head) that are painful the heat may help to open up your eustacian tubes you can use something like afrin (oxymetazoline) nasal spray to help reduce the swelling however it should not be used more than twice a day for no longer than 3 to 5 days maximum to avoid developing chronic congestion problems i can only use afrin for two days before it becomes ineffective you can also use over the counter decongestants normally  this type of problem with heal with time
439,i i am sure your dentist is legit the question is why are you having so may problems so soon after your treatment has been completed firstly  most teeth that have had root canal therapy are pretty broken down to begin with  so crowns are usually indicated right after the root canal therapy (usually but not always) i don't think your teeth were entirely intact before the crowns were begun (again  tooth needed root canal therapy since it was broken down) you are correct an adequate amount of tooth structure  above the gumline  should remain to help support the post and the crown were posts placed in the teeth in question if not  then the little tooth structure you had left may not have been enough to support the crown as advised by the other panelists  you need an unbiased opinion from someone who can physically examine you best of luck
440,i i recommend that you see a neurologist to find out if you have complex migraine headaches it is important to determine the cause
441,yearly (begin @ 40) mammograms remain our best test to screen for breast cancer most us experts advise starting at 40 (or 10 yrs younger than a close family member who had breast ca) the lump you describe sounds classic for fibrocystic changes: lumpy-bumpy breast tissue that is sensitive to hormonal changes if you find a new lump  it is always best to see your gyne or primary care dr to be extra-cautious
442,drs drs zweig and mcleod have given you good advice sometimes the gum is irritated from the cleaning  sometimes a bit of calculus may have lodged in the space between the gum and tooth  causing an inflammatory response regarding the dentist you are currently seeing the choice is yours you should feel comfortable with the person who is treating you if you were  you wouldn't be asking for our advice you would have called him first best of luck to you
443,lymphedema arm swelling after breast cancer surgery used to be an all-too-common occurrence secondary to the removal of many of the lymph nodes under the armpit  the incidence of lymphedema increases in response to radiation therapy that encompasses this areamodern techniques for lymph node evaluation (sentinel lymph node biopsy) remove far fewer lymph nodes  dramatically reducing the risk of lymphedema
444,yes yes to both since you can't have radiation twice in the same breast  most women need a mastectomy if the cancer returns after breast-sparing surgery you have several reconstruction options after previous radiation  depending on how your breast tissue responded to radiation talk to a plastic surgeon about options
445,if if your stone has not passed by now  and you are still in pain you should see your doctor or present to an urgent care or er if it is after hours you may be dealing with an infectious process as well this needs to be investigated good luck
446,pacifier better but it is likely too late your child always has access to the thumb  and it can do significant harm especially if respiratory patterns and facial growth pattern is genetically problematic pacifier usually smaller and bears less weight than the thumb any sucking habit will tend to narrow the upper jaw and cause front tooth occlusion to be harmed
447,because because this is now impacting your functioning  i recommed that you seek evaluation by a hand surgeon
448,possible neuropathy depending on the affected nerves  symptoms of diabetic neuropathy can range from a numbness and tingling sensation  possibly a burning sensation  to an uncomfortable painful sensation of the extremities neuropathy may affect your digestive system  urinary tract  blood vessels and the heart for some people  the symptoms are mild; for others  it can be painful and disabling
449,knee this is one of those time when acupuncture might help -and won't hurt to try check with family doc for a referral or orthopedist
450,cold only stop the heat and switch to cold packs heat may make you swell  cold will do the opposite you should follow your dentist's instructions that should include warm salt water rinses
451,always always you should be able to contact your dentist if you have any concerns about your treatment or recovery though it sounds as if all is going well the antibiotics generally take 48 - 72 hours to kick in and start making you feel better however  there is a small percentage of cases that do not respond to the particular antibiotics you are using and the infection actually can get dramatically worse very quickly that is why you should contact your dentist if there are questions regarding this
452,cracked cracked teeth are often hard to detect some of the clues that we can use when xrays are normal include: 1 no prior restoration (filling) with pain to biting can suggest a crack/fracture 2 use of a tooth sleuth or bite stick to test different corners of the tooth could detect a weak point 3 a cbct (cone beam ct) can help visualize a fracture 4 pulp testing can determine if a particular tooth is more sensitive to thermal stimuli than other teeth
453,a a neti pot can help to cleanse the sinus/ nasal area however  it will not cure an infection that is in place if there are signs of infection  she should see her physician
454,hello hello you might wish to see a podiatrist if you are diabetic  it is best to have foot care done by a professional a podiatrist can work with the callouses injections is an option however  an adjunct to your care could be medical acupuncture it is performed by do's and md's and can be helpful with a variety of sources of foot pain including neuropathic pain
455,return to sports this timeline is generally 6 to 8 weeks that being said you should consult the orthopedic surgeon who performed the surgery as he or she may alter this normal course based on your intraoperative findings
456,might be tmj there are many things you could have sometimes significant clenching of your teeth can cause muscle spasms the temporalis muscles go along side your head and under your hair try ibuprofen every six hours  try a cold pack along the sore part of your head eat a soft diet  be aware if you might be clenching your teeth if so  see a tmj or bite dentist for help to break the spasms
457,ice cube foot any of the things you are describing should be evaluated by your surgeon sooner rather than later especially since your calf also hurts call right away and head for an er if your surgeon should be unavailable good luck
458,orthotics & exercise sometimes orthotics and cushioned shoes may help-including soft mats on the surfaces you stand on try to keep moving when standing ease into & out of your rest periods stretch your shins and calves during these periods if you are obese-this will contribute and so losing weight would be appropriate orthotics
459,see below herpes simplex is a common virus found in humans there are two main types  referred to as type i and type ii igg stands for immunoglobulin git is an antibody found in the human body igm is immunoglobulin manother antibody it shows up early on in an infection and is used to differentiate certain types of infections
460,great toe pain consider gout  fracture  sprain  ingrown nail  painful hallux valgus (bunion)  infection  tumor(less likely  but possible)
461,you should discuss your concerns with your radiation oncologist not have the radiation will increase the chances the cancer will come back
462,very unlikely while nothing is impossible  the classic symptom of mass effect from a brain tumor is a focal neurologic sign (such as one-sided weakness  or slurred speech) rather than vague headaches and nausea/dizziness the differential for what you are reporting is vast  with brain tumor being a very  very distant cotnender
463,get examined you need a comprehensive work-up to include blood test  stool test  possibly colonoscopy  chest xray  urinalysis etc you could have ibs  pulmonary infection  hormonal imbalance etc go see an internist who may refer you to a gastroenterologist give us a feedback on the final dx
464,quality if you want  you can look for aggressive treatment for her or getting her entered in a study it is her decision i'd urge you to focus at this time on making her last months (or it may be years) matter remember the good times  seek healing if need be  stay involved with her and help her do and enjoy the things that are important to her add life to the time  more than time to the life bless you
465,xanax although dose is low  some sedation can occur
466,perhaps but you should run the decision and discuss dosing with the prescribing doctor first
467,repeat hcg if there has been an ectopic pregnancy  it's important to repeat the hcg tests until the level drops below 5 units
468,may be viral most ear infections  up to 85%  are caused by viruses that won't respond to ab there is also the possibility that his infection is due to a bacteria that's resistant to amoxil when you say he has been on 3d of amoxil are you counting the first day as the day you started the medication? if so then he has only had 2 days worth and it might be that you need to give amox more time good luck
469,speak with your doc you should discuss these concerns with your treating oncologist
470,lymphadenopathy unlikely that this is related to your ear infection lymphnodes typically drain regional anatomy if you had a finger/forearm infection  than it would be plausible
471,sounds like the surgeon was worried enough about that possibility to inform you that mesh could not correct the entire defect at the time of your repair
472,probably not repair of a hydrocele should not cause a problem with sexual performance your surgeon should be able to give a clear idea of the risks and benefits of surgery
473,typically yes if the bleeding you had one year ago was due to colon cancer  you would have had a number of progressive symptoms by now  so i wouldn't worry (plus colon cancer is very uncommon at age 26) if however bleeding recurs or persist have it evaluated
474,see the doctor it would be wise in this case to have him seen by the physician to determine what the illness really is
475,talk to dentist taking probiotics or eating yogurt with active cultures about 2 hours after taking each antibiotic may help to re-populate your digestive tract with good bacteria and reduce heartburn or other stomach distress  etc but talk to your dentist for their exact recommendation  considering your problem
476,nothing special the recovery period is usually unremarkable the first few days the patient may require some soft diet due to discomfort with swallowing liquids should be tepid rather than too hot or cold there may be some visible coating in the beds where tonsills used to be he may need to take some ibuprofen to help reduce the postoperative pain and inflammation
477,healing i am assuming that your decompression is secondary to spinal stenosis because of the multiple levels if this was performed in a nonmiss way  then the pain intensity may be due to the ongoing healing of the muscles  scar tissue and weakness if after 6 months the pain intensity has not decreased then further evaluation by your spine surgeon is warranted
478,not good if you have bone on bone at the knee joint (femorotibial joint) at age 32  it's not good weight loss (unless you're underweight) helps because every 1 lb lost takes 4 lb of pressure off the knee braces may help stability rx and/or cortisone injections or hyaluronic acid injections may make things livable surgery sounds inevitable but you may be able to delay
479,oligometastatic patients with a single brain tumor as the only site of metastatic disease are called oligometastatic  the chance of cure  though small  is real every cancer specialist has a few such patients i would strongly recommend aggressive treatment  including either radiosurgery (cyberknife  gammaknife  etc) to the brain or surgical resection  and again stereotactic or chemoradiation to the lung
480,infection sounds like an oral or jaw infection see oral surgeon asap
481,see a physician you are probably suffering from pharyngitis you should consult a physician to get tested for strep throat sometimes it can be from infectious mono also called the kissing disease your physician can prescribe you antibiotics if it is diagnosed as strep or bacterial pharyngitis
482,see your doctor you need to see your doctor for an examination to evaluate these symptoms
483,need an evaluation i agree with my colleagues suggestions below that you should be seen by an ob/gyn if you have not had sex since your last abortion  this may represent a persistence of a pregnancy or incomplete abortion from 3 mos ago if you have had sex & have conceived again  then you need to discuss your options with a physician (& family  etc) & also consider more effective contraception for the future
484,possible pain is often referred between the ear and the lower teeth  or in this case where they used to be if you have an earache  you may also get pain in your lower jaw if you have a toothache  sometimes it can make your ear hurt your physician can look in your ears and your dentist can check your mouth between the 2 you should be able to find the cause
485,see a breast surgeon i would not recommend a mammogram for a 28 yr old women i advise you to see a breast surgeon (ideally one who performs ultrasound) they can assess the significance of this lump and decide what  if anything  needs to be done in my practice we will see people asap under these circumstances due to the anxiety inherent with this problem
486,umbilical pain pain inside your umbilicus could be a symptom of a small hernia there are some other possibilities okay to check in with your doc an ultrasound of the abdominal wall can be helpful
487,time will tell after stopping depo-provera it can take a while for periods to get back to normal over the next few menstrual cycles you will get a feel for what they are going to be like if they continue to be heavy then see your doctor to discuss your options
488,a good idea the only way that you will know that everything is ok  is to see a dentist just to be sure it is not uncommon for dental problems to temporarily resolve  only to come back with a vengeance the pain that you experienced might have been temporary and require no treatment only a dentist who personally examines you can tell you that for sure better to be safe than sorry  as the saying goes
489,need eval you should get a brain mri with and without contrast to evaluate your brain more detail non contrast head ct is only a very limited test further w/u is absolutely needed go to see your md right away
490,gallbladder  liver yoy are experiencing right sided pain going to the back this could be from the liver  gallbladder  pancreas  and even lung talk to your doctor he/she may to blood work and other tests make sure you write down what makes the pain start  what makes it better or worse
491,see an expert see a tmj expert to help evaluate and treat your problem a tmj expert can be general dentist  an oral surgeon  prosthodontist  orofacial pain specialist ask your physician  dentist or dental society for a recommendation
492,yes it is possible to do the sentinel lymph node prior
493,? one can go with lumpectomy alone if they accept a risk of 3-5% per year of local failure leading to breast loss  and a loss of the survival benefit of raiotherapy however  all cases are not amenable to lumpectomy (size to big  persistent postive margins) there are plenty of good surgeons and radiation oncologists that will work with you
494,yes you are basically describing chronic sinusitis patients with chronic sinusitis typically don't have the nasal discharge that you get with allergies or acute sinusitis but it can lead to chronic nasal stuffiness/congestion/malaise best study for diagnosis: coronal ct of sinuses without contrast - essential for diagnosis
495,likely knee cap the most common and likely cause of pain in front of the knee is an irritated or early wear of the knee cap cartilage or the surface cartilage of the thigh bone that it rubs other causes could include a plica  patellar tendonitis etc for starters avoid knee extension machines  deep knee squats  lunges etc try therapy  antiinflammatories  ice and sometimes a knee sleeve see an orthopedist
496,maybe it might be due to an issue with your teeth or it might be due to the mucsles secondary to some time of extra function (grining and/or clenching) of the teeth
497,ra maybe; lupus no blood tests for ra are negative in up to 30 percent of cases the screening blood test for lupus is negative only rarely
498,possible arthritis the onset and progression of your symptoms suggest that your joints are becoming painful one after the other headaches can occur from arthritis in neck swelling in hands from arthritis can compress the median nerve in hand causing symptoms of ct syndrome
499,psoriasis stay away from any harsh things on the skin topical hydrocortisone may help as well as some sun exposure many times psoriasis will require prescription medications if you have already been diagnosed with it by your doctor
500,it depends the line of the fracture best determines the best film to take if the line of the fracture is not known  then multiple views may be the best way to find the line of fracture to answer your question  a panoramic x-ray may find all the damage or it may not; it depends on the line of fracture
501,abcd's remember your abcd's when thinking of melanoma look for moles with asymmetry boarders that are irregular color differences within the same mole diameter greater than 6mm also any new mole or old that starts to itch  bleed or ulcerate should be of concern another rule is the ugly duckling rule which refers to a mole that looks distantly different from the others on your body
502,not enough info without more information it is difficult to give an opinion you may also have both problems you might consider seeing a specialist in tmj diagnosis see wwwaaoporg or wwwaacfporg
503,check black moles chances are the mole is benign but if it is black and different from your other moles it needs to be checked out skin cancer caught early can be cured with surgical removal do not delay
504,emg nerves cann be damaged by reasons other than injury and back(spine) issues inflammatory  toxic  infectios causes can result in nerve damage if the emg sgows significant nerve damage the task now is to find the cause - its clearly not your spine given the mri
505,see below sound like your not a happy camper but whats your question the bunps on your tongue probably are taste buds but you should see someone for a comprehensive exam
506,yes large tonsils or adenoids are a common cause of sleep apnea in children snoring and gasping for air are signs of sleep apnea you should get your child into their doctor asap and have the tonsils and adenoids checked for removal
507,hematuria blood in the urine can be due to stones  infection (often tuberculosis)  or malignancy this should be thoroughly evaluated and not ignored would see a urologist or nephrologist and follow up with them
508,no if pregnant  the blood test will definitely be positive after 2 weeks is it possible that you could have ovulated later?
509,acl continued instabilty after acl sugery could indicate failure of the original surgery or misplacement of the graft
510,not realted you need to see your physician to clarify why you are doing this
511,immune workup you have certainly tried a variety of medical and surgical treatments for the very frustrating problem of chronic rhino-sinusitis one avenue of evaluation which you may have missed is to check whether your immune system is working properly ask the allergist if this has been evaluated you will need to check whether you make good quality and quantity antibodies
512,creams not effective if you have a dark mole you can not remove it with creams nor should you try the only way to remove a true mole is to excise it completely if your mole has irregular features it should be evaluated by your doctor
513,see a urologist you may have deposits of smug a consult a urologist for help
514,get 3rd opinion pigmented skin lesions are the most troublesome biopsies in pathology the very fact of recurrence would make the original pathologist eager to have the glass slides seen by colleagues your physician can arrange this and don't hesitate to have the lesion re-excised with a fair margin a recurrent pigmented skin lesion probably looks nastier than any scar best wishes
515,what's the cause cellulitis is basically a visible inflammation (itis) of the skin and soft tissues (red  hot  swollen and tender)  it can be caused by many things including sunburn (radiation)  trauma (sprained ankle) or poor vein circulation (stasis dermatitis) it need not be caused by bacteria if you have repeated episodes of this  get to a wound care or vascular specialist  the diagnoses you have is wrong
516,dvt your foot is probably swollen from the trauma of knee surgery  but it can be swollen from a blood clot in your leg  which can be extremely dangerous deep venous thrombus can have formed in one of the deep veins in your leg causing the swelling in your footknee surgery puts you at a very high risk for this it can be very dangerous as this can progress to a pulmonary embolismso get checked out
517,you don't go toer any sudden chest pain due to unknown cause must go to nearest er to make sure it is not an heart attach  save the life   there is no home remedy kit to rule out
518,2 things the white fingers could be raynaud's phenomenon -- the simple treatment is to always keep your hands warm (wear mittens and not gloves in the cold) the lump on your wrist is most likely a ganglion cyst -- it may resolve spontaneously or never really bother you enough to do anything with it you could take meds if your fingers become painful; you could have surgery is your cyst gets in the way
519,see dentist i would suggest seeing a dentist trained in diagnosing and treating the tmj
520,very unlikely if you are asking about the risk after a single head ct scan it is not measureable and is not considered a risk for developing a brain tumor if for some reason you have many routine head ct scans especially if done throughout childhood there is a very small slight increase risk of developing a tumor but far less than 5% the low dose of radiation from modern ct scans is negligible if used safe
521,no a simple cyst is benign
522,often not but our design is protective here the forehead in toddlers is thicker than other parts of the skull and if he shows no signs of altered behavior nor illness it is probably ok make his brother stop roughing him up
523,maybe i would definitely have him evaluated he could have a bacteria that is resistant to the amoxicillin it is also possible that there is another source for the fever
524,needs biopsy an enlarging or changing mole should be addressed by excisional biopsy see your dermatologist or plastic surgeon to have it addressed the obvious concern is a change or dysplasia in a mole which can lead to melanoma
525,follow up with the doctor who performed the procedure sometimes  there may be a piece of nail that was not removed  other times a cyst may of developed where the procedure was performed
526,not likely try taking a bulk laxative like metamucil  a couple of table spoonfuls each day for a couple of weeks to see if the symptoms resolve if that does not help  it would be time to see a doctor
527,no exposure is exposure the only way to worsen it would be to move from anal to vaginal sex without properly cleaning
528,lumps are not always even no cancerous  benign lumps can grow if not already done  you should have a clinical evaluation and an ultrasound don't assume this is cancer if the mass is solid it should be biopsies - preferred method: core biopsy
529,most likely normal agree with the other answer want to add that the most common after effects of a minor head injury  or concussion  are: headache  mild dizziness  and sometimes mild confusion these almost always get better with time
530,gain muscle mass a single 5 g (5000 mg) oral dose in healthy adults results in a peak plasma creatine level of approximately 120 mg/l at 1–2 hours post-ingestion creatine has a fairly short elimination half-life  averaging just less than 3 hours  so to maintain an elevated plasma level it would be necessary to take small oral doses every 3–6 hours throughout the day follow directions!
531,optic nerve oct there is a disease called benign intra-cranial hypertension (bih) or previously known as pseudo-tumor cerebri oct is an ocular ct scan that many ophthalmologists have often bih is misdiagnosed as migraine if your oct showed optic nerve swelling (elevation) and nasal decrease of optic nerve fibers you need to have a spinal tap by your neurologist to rule this easily treated condition out
532,unlikely it is unlikely that a tumor has developed in 4 mths there are many causes of headaches like sinus problems  migraines  temporal arteritis   tmj issues  high blood pressure etc you need to see your family doc or a neurologist to get evaluated and treated
533,yes a headache is one of the expected side effects of starting on zoloft you can take aspirin or ibuprofen or whatever you would usually do to help it it should improve over the next 8 days  but may come back briefly if your doctor increases your dose
534,no lies surgical training is accomplished mostly by trainees gradually performing more and more of an operation under the direct supervision of the attending surgeon in the us  make no mistake that the surgeon is primarily responsible for every aspect of your operation  and takes that responsibility very seriously while there are exceptions to every rule  you are getting who they say you're getting
535,dense breasts do decrease the sensitivity of mammo for detecting cancer  but screening mammo is still the standard of care for dense breasts dense breasts are also a risk factor for the development of cancer the amount of radiation from a mammo is minimal  you are 250 times more likely to die in a car accident than get a radiation induced cancer the benefits of early detection outweigh the slight rad risk
536,here are some… i'm glad to see you have received such wonderful medical care; however  based on currently available information  it would be most logical to direct your current concern & question to the treating doctor for confirmation & counseling so to minimize potential confusion and anxiety  which commonly results from online inquiry of course  make sure to supply detailed hx stressing sequence of events
537,maybe mri i can't examine you but   do you play any sports ? to you jump alot ? the little bump/bone of the top of your shin is your tibia tubercle and becomes swollen/irratated from this type of movement
538,no if its a pimple a pimple is not an std there are some infections that one might confuse with a pimple so getting an exam is your next step genital warts  herpes  syphilis and moluscum could be confused with a pimple
539,probably not but if you are passing gas and having bowel movements that is reassuring but in anyone with recent surgery who finds themselves suddenly having worsening abdominal pain it would be prudent to see their primary care provider or general surgeon who did the surgery if the pain worsens or persists

707,unstable vitals those are considered unstable vital signs call your doctor or get to one asap

716,calluses corns/calluses form from friction against the skin  but also moisture is needed on top of changing shoes and socks  try moisture control by using spray deodorant on your feet this helps decrease moisture also file them down daily in the shower or use vicks vapor rub to soften them up lastly  off-load the areas to take pressure off and prevent reformation hope this helps! good lucks!
717,only a small subset i watched the video and it's a hybrid procedure between a microfracture surgery and a modified osteochondral autograft procedure both of these procedures have guarded results and are reserved for acute cartilage injuries  not for fulminant arthritis with changes in mechanical alignment unfortunately  for your age group  there are very few individuals that would benefit from this procedure
718,probably i'm assuming you're talking about bovine colostrum any medication or supplement can cause temporary hair loss (technical name: telogen effluvium)  and it nearly always grows back; but you'll have to give it some time insulin-like growth factors (igf) are probably not the mediators in such situations  but no one knows for sure biotin (a b vitamin) 5000 units/day may help to speed up regrowth
719,could be either there is a lot of overlap between premenstrual symptoms and early pregnancy symptoms even light bleeding around the time of an expected period can occur with pregnancy a home pregnancy test and/or a blood test at your doctor's office may help clear things up after testing  if you are pregnant or still have unexplained symptoms consult your doctor

724,rest  ice & elevate! some swelling after surgery is normal the amount and location may not be the type of surgery is important  but post-op care is a very big factor simple ice and elevation with range of motion exercises when called for can prevent or reduce swelling sometimes rest alone with elevation of the feet to eye level for several days will do it joint surgery usually requires motion to heal properly
725,root canal most endodontists ( root canal specialists) complete root canals in one visit sometimes complications will require a second visit at this point you should have the tooth re-evaluated by an endodontist
726,melanoma yes melanoma has a genetic component all direct relatives should be aware of watching for skin changes that could predict cancer
727,yes  can happen some supplements can cause flushing  which could well feel like a hot flash  and niacin is a common offender several meds are listed also as causing flushing  such as the new ms drug tecfidera the physicians desk reference will be an all-inclusive source to assist your search and confirm or disconfirm possibilities also  discuss with your doctors

731,no & maybe hcg should only be present in someone who is pregnant +hcg weeks before menses could indicate an early pregnancy  there are also uncommon tumors of the ovary that can cause +hcg levels in patient who are not pregnant (a couple of other very rare conditions can cause also) and  lastly  people who use hcg administration for weight loss will have + levels in their system
732,why take risks??? mrsa aside  why are you sleeping with a child cosleeping with infants is associated with suffication deaths (see aap position statement pediatrics 11/11) by mid childhood this fosters dependence at a time when kids should begin to create their own individuality & accomplishments
733,also consider lice! in my area it is an epidemic among grade school aged children if you're around any children  it might be worth combing through your hair with a lice comb to see if any of the little buggers are there if so treat for lice and you're cured! andlice prefer clean hair to dirty hair so this suggestion is no judgment on you!

736,i would not be surprised if you have sleep apnea get it checked out

740,ulnar nerve the ulnar nerve is succeptable to trauma at the elbow as it passes around a groove on the medial side called the cubital tunnel avoiding excessive elbow flexion and cushioned elbow protector can help anti-inflammatory meds or pain meds like neurontin may also help evaluation by a nerve specialist like a neurosurgeon is warranted if there is progressive numbness in the fingers or hand weakness
741,no you're more likely to be hit my a meteorite than to have stomach cancer it's something else  and probably nothing bad relax if it gets worse  get it checked out
742,slight chance of the palpable lesions of parotid  about 80% are benign and 20% malignant rate of transformation in the latter group not well defined but if it occurs   bx of tumor mass difficult to obtain in terms of adequate sampling as such most are surgically resected for dx unless palpable nodes present major operation is defining landmarks of the nerve at stylomastoid foramen
743,depends most cases of stress urinary incontinence (sui) are the result of pelvic relaxation due to vaginal deliveries for many women  kegel exercises can decrease the symptoms of sui if your incontinence is affecting your daily activities  you should see a gynecologist or a urologist for diagnostic testing and discussion of treatment options

745,i agree with the other doctors comments i would add though that the peak of swelling is usually 72 hours post surgery  so your tennis ball may even get larger once swelling presents  it is difficult to modify this ice for the first 48 hours & then on third day moist heat application to help reduce swelling a tennis ball size swelling is a bit excessive though motrin 800mg  & narcotic for pain - & time
746,unlikely dvt cases are multifactorial  usually because of stasis of blood in the legs( e g bed ridden patients)  hypercoagulable disorders (eg cancer patient or hereditary disease  oral contraceptive pills) or injury to the deep venous system unless your tight jeans are resticting flow of blood from your legs( cannot walk   swollen legs ) then they would not be a causative factor
747,second opinion symetrical (both sides) swelling/inflammation of joints is often a sign of an underlying auto-immune disease ra is one of many there are conditions that have no test for (as of yet) and they are called seronegative arthritis ( ie tests are negative ) they can be treated with the same medications as ra but it is a clinical judgement based on the doctor's analysis and the severity of complaints

758,depends this condition is unrelated to your breast cancer history ask your doctor what concerns or not are registered by the radiologists some type of thyroid calcifications are more likely to be benign 6mm thyroid nodule is small & need to know risks of trying biopsy near carotid artery too the doctor who ordered the study would know much more to help you than is able to be reported here
759,probably-no warranty in all likelihood  you will be able to nurse however it is possible that significant ductal damage may be incurred  that nursing may be difficult or impossible if this is a major concern  you should either avoid implants until after completion of pregnancies or consider breast crease or armpit incisions remember that even without implants nursing may not be possible

778,not really if it is happening while asleep   i do not know how you feel those experiences  in any case if this is not happening all the time particularly while awake   it is most likely some benign process  even if it is happening all the time it is sign of what we call peripheral neuropathy which is caused by multiple condition  diabetes is by far the most common cause
779,false:talk to ur doc pelvic surgery  whether total or partial hysterectomy  vaginal or abdominal  w/ or w/o oophorectomy  does not render you asexual sure you might have some initial post-op discomfort and if ovaries are taken  you may (not) need menopausal hormone therapy (new catchphrase) but once recovered  you can be as sexually active as you once were be sure to ask your gyn about any & all questions pre-op
780,see a neurologist if the headaches are severe and episodic  you could be having migraines this in particular  if there are visual symptoms such as flashing like or if there is sensitivity to light a neurologist should be able to help to diagnosis and treat this you may also need additional brain imaging studies like an mri scan depending on what the neurologist finds on your physical exam and history
781,skin lesion i would recommend you have a dermatologist examine this mole
782,can't tell it is too early to say from your info  it appears that you are/were being treated for a breast abscess the antibiotics resolved the fever  but the abscess mass may persist and need surgical drainage even if it is abscess

803,too dangerous? it's likely several factors  some of which may not be evident procedures all come with risks and benefits-it may just be that the abscess is in a location that may affect delicate nerves or it's too large to do it without anaesthesia alternatively  your dentist may not be qualified to perform the procedure; it may be a job of an oromaxillofacial surgeon (omfs)

823,it would vary depending on the extent of the infection typically after the extraction and thorough debridement of the socket  one would like to wait 4-6 weeks before re-entry to do the bone graft or place the implant or both your treating dentist would make the best recommendation based on your situation hope this helps
824,yes! it is important to keep bacteria out of the access hole and a temporary restoration will help also  it is important to have a permanent restoration to prevent bacteria from seeping into the tooth and causing further decay of the remaining tooth structure this should be done within a month or two after having the root canal completed

1237,recurrent problem the collapsed lung is called a spontaneous pneumothorax if it happens without prior trauma if he has anatomical blebs in his lung or his doctors feel he is at high risk for recurrence they may do a bleb resection and/or a pleurodesis which is deliberate scarring to force the lung to adhere to the chest wall so it can't collapse again as is prone to happen in some people
1238,mouth breathing it is not uncommon with osa that an individual may have nasal airway insufficiency and thus breathe primary through their mouth this dysfunctional breathing pattern may lead to an enlarged tongue and at night during sleep  nocturnal bruxism continues except rather grinding and clenching on the teeth  the enlarged tongue takes the brunt of the damage
1239,not to worry breast pain may be a sign of cancer  however  breast pain is far more commonly due to benign processes cyclic changes in hormone levels are a common cause of breast pain if this persists beyond a few cycles  i suggest you see your gyne for a breast exam having a 60 yr old g'mother w/breast cancer should not change your risks & at age 20 your chance of cancer is 1in a million

1241,possible bakers cyst as well as nerve entrapment see an orthopedist
1242,because  if a suspicious lesion is noted on mammography an us is obtained this allows for better definition of the lesion in the breast however  a negative us does not rule out an underlying problem and the correct next step is to proceed with your physicians recommendation  in this case a biopsy none of the imaging techniques are perfect  the final decision is based on all the information
1243,yes possibly popping or clicking of the joint is very difficult to eliminate  even with surgery if you have no pain and no locking (limited opening or trouble closing  ) then you may have to live with the popping conservative treatment can help diminish or cut down the popping  but you should seek out a tmj/tmd specialist
1244,biopsy most of the cold nodules on thyroid scans are benign but cancer has to be ruled out thyroid biopsy is a relatively noninvasive and simple procedure to perform and can give the answer i would definitely suggest to start with a biopsy as an initial step then   if it is inconclusive or you feel very uncomfortable  talk to your physician good luck

1248,possibly mri and chest x-rays are not 100% sensitive it's possible that the mri could have missed cancer if your symptoms are not resolving in spite of medical therapy  then you should look into getting re-evaluated i think cancer would be low on the list at your age  but certainly not unheard of the pain is telling you something  so be sure to get a solid diagnosis
1249,bad headache the answer would depend largely on how long have you had this type of headache if this is a pattern you have had for many years  then the chances of some type oof pathology are low if it is a very recent onset  then it should be investigated by a qulified headache specialist
1250,ask them if there is a focal lesion which can be followed or removed you need the highest quality imaging sedation 32 channel 3t head coil is needed if your hospital does not have this - ask your surgeon if they know of a place that has this this gives you the best chance to find a seizure focus just for instance i found a seizure focus in a patient missed by two prior scans so ask for it
1251,yes without premedication  swelling can be common with anti-inflammatory and anti-swelling perscription pre medications  these unpleasant effects of wisdom teeth removal can be managed quite comfortably discuss this with your treating dentist
1252,viral this could be viral infection  i e ebv  flu  cmv  adenovirus  rhinovirus or assoicated secondary bacterial infection need to see your doctor and needs testing and appropriate testing

1257,you should visit a doctor and have it checked out at minimum  you likely should be wearing an ankle brace if you injure the ankle and it is unstable and you continue to walk on it you are not allowing it to heal properly
1258,get checked out depending on where you live  where you've traveled and a variety of other factors that you haven't mentioned  the best advice is to seek the advice of a local health care provider if you live in the us and based on your age  the most likely problem is an infection (bronchitis or pneumonia) you'll want to get this checked out soonest
1259,probably not once dental decay breaks down tooth structure it is considered irreversible it is necessary to restore the tooth to its normal shape and size with a filling otherwise the cavitation or hole will become a food trap and will increase in size

1265,probably not most likely it is plantar fasciitis stress fractures in the heel can occur  but they usually heal within 6-10 weeks an x ray will be able to tell for sure
1266,see a doctor see a doctor that specializes in head  neck and mouth pain a lot of these symptoms can be explained by tension of the muscles in the neck  temporal area  and jaw muscles this type a doctor can identify and treat the problem areas accordingly
1267,unlikely your symptoms are too nonspecific for ms  and suggests a very different etiology my first thought is to evaluate for tarsal tunnel syndrome or a peripheral neuropathy of small fibre type
1268,several many general dentists are well trained and qualified and routinely remove wisdom teeth in their practices oral surgeons have advanced training and often treat the more complicated or difficult cases and may be better equipped to handle complications that may occur although some general dentists may offer iv sedation  most oral surgeons offer iv sedation or general anesthesia routinely
1269,anxiety your description sounds like you have some eye irritation from dry eye causing your headaches and pain the left cheek tingling is likely a manifestation of your anxiety i would try artificial tears during the day  ointment at night  warm compresses  and omega-3 fatty acid supplements if no improvement  see an eye doctor for further treatment
1270,need follow-up soon! not sure how long these symptoms have been present  but this requires attention soon - you may have an infection that will not resolve on its own  and the swelling could be problematic by itself seek medical help for this right away

1274,see below it's likely that the antibiotic altered the bacetrial flora causing the odor

1282,depends this really depends on how high your blood pressure is  how well it is controlled and what other medical problems that you have i recommend seeing a board certified plastic surgeon who could discuss this issue with you and help you determine the best course of treatment for you
1283,yes those symptoms could all reflect a colon cancer  and that is what needs to be ruled out by a physician it could possilby be other causes  diverticular disease  ibs  malabsorption syndromes  but the most worrisome possible cause (colon cancer) still remains pretty high on the list of possibilities seek medical attention please!
1284,save your money see a dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon injecting vitamins will be a waste of time & money homeopathy is strictly placebo only for tv you need only makeup don't believe the hype a few blemishes are never ugly major scars can be improved with cosmetic proceedures if it sounds too good to be true  it is not true

1289,if if you are young it will be simple your surgeon only needs to remove enough bone to get the tooth out that's what i call a window the bone will heal back uneventfully you will not be in the pain you are imagining but the first week after surgery you will be sore and eating will take more effort after the second week you can get back to eating that beef jerky so don't fret it will go well

1291,no 10 to 15 percent of breast cancers can not be seen on mammograms even if a mass or other finding is physically identified for that reason women are told to examine themselves monthly and see their doctor for an exam yearly or more if they have prior history of breast cancer that was treated
1292,yes in small cancers with no spread standard radiation and radiosurgery can cure lung cancer but the standard of care is surgery in more advanced cancer radiation can cure but is more effective with chemotherapy i am referring to nonsmall cell types of lung cancer
1293,perio endo lesion there could be two different things going on with your crown dull ache and radiating nerve pain indicates that the nerve in your tooth is diseases and you should be evaluated for root canal it also sounds like your dentist is concerned about a gum  periodontal problem in this area also perio-endo lesions can occur together and need to be treated together
1294,hard to say one white spot on brain mri is nonspecific if it is in a particular area (corpus callosum) it would be more concerning  otherwise it could have been from prior brain infection (encephalitis) or trauma (shearing injury) your symptoms are a bit more worrisome perhaps a spinal fluid analysis will help neurology consult would be useful
1295,yes it improves survival significantly in stage 1-3 lung cancers cyberknife provides survival similar to surgery in stage 1 patients for stage 2-3 patients  both chemo and radiation may be used to improve survival in certain patients with stage 4 cancer (such as with spread to the brain) radiation may help improve survival
1296,symptoms symptoms of middle ear fluid can include dizziness  nausea  or vomiting  headache  plugged ears  trouble hearing and ringing in your ears if there is a middle ear infection you could also have a fever and feel weak

1299,possibly radiation can injure the lung tissue therefore since copd is already an injury they can be additive the radiation doctor needs to know values for fvc and fev1 (tell you how good the lung is) and consider these in his planning for the radiation the majority of lung cancer is in smokers and most have copd so its just how bad it is and how much lung is going to be radiated
1300,prevention is best if you are beginning to have some signs and symptoms it is best to see about early treatment as the results are quicker  better and less damage can occur check with your dentist as it sounds like you are in the early stages of development  which may be reversible with proper diagnosis and / or treatment
1301,absolutely lymph nodes should be checked by a doctor and not on the internet
1302,your your physician and surgeon should have reviewed the pros and cons of a cholecystectomy now versus waiting for worsening symptoms there is always a possibility of another source  but when a well known cause of upper abdominal pain is identified  additional work up is unlikely to identify a reason not to remove the gallbladder removal of the gallbladder poses the least amount of risk when it is not inflamed (cholecystitis) and if the stones are small  there is an ongoing risk of pancreatitis as long as the gallbladder and stones remain a full history  physical exam  and studies have been performed by your physician; i recommend following your surgeon's advice or seeking another opinion a laparoscopic cholecystectomy is easier to recover from than an open procedure or pancreatitis don j peterson  md facebookcom/donpetersonmd
1303,biopsy i agree a nodule this big should be biopsied chance of malignancy is low but you need to do it to find out
1304,my my you are familiar with the terminology! congratulations  are you in the medical field? now then  clearly with a pain on biting something is wrong with the tooth or the bone supporting it an endodontist teat root canal problems  and your general dentist will repair and rebuild a tooth that has been root treated these two work as a team i recommend that you go and see you regular dentist and explain the problem  get some x-rays and pressure testing done on the teeth  and remember to ask to include testing for root fractures the fact that the muscles produce the pain when you move them is a clear sign that there is some kind of pressure being placed by them on a tender area when they contract it is time to get the problem checked good luck  dr neil mcleod dentistry that lasts - quality that counts
1305,without without examining you  it is hard to say for sure what you have you could be having an initial infection of herpes causing your symptoms  or you may have another viral illness such as coxsackie virus (hand  foot and mouth illness often seen in little kids) or herpangina (sore throat due to ulcers) to know for certain  you should give your doctor a call and have them take a look if your fever persists above 104f  fever remains for more than 5 days  if your vomiting worsens  if you think you are dehydrated  or if you feel sicker after 3-4 days instead of better you should see your doctor good luck!
1306,as as david stated prior you may have a blockage or stone in the duct you should see an ent or oral surgeon who can handle the problem correctly you should definitely get x-rays or a ct done to determine what is going on if you have a stone many times it can be removed without a problem but if this is a chronic issue or has a stone rather large then the gland may need to be removed it is hard to treat over the web and only having a specialist who does these procedure examine you and gives you a proper diagnosis will be able to help you out good luck!
1307,? molluscum there are many possibilities  but one that fits your description might be molluscum contagiosum this is a viral infection of the skin you should see a health professional for further evaluation
1308,i i assume that you are referring to amalgam or silver fillings as regular fillings  and dental bonding as bonded composite fillings either one replaces the lost tooth structure destroyed by cavities amalgam fillings look unesthetic  conduct hot and cold more to the nerves of the teeth  and therefore often cause more sensitivity when drinking or eating very hot and cold liquids or food bonded composite fillings sometimes wear more than amalgam fillings  but look more esthetic  often appear invisible and actually bond to tooth structure  thereby making them stronger  rather than weaker once filled generally speaking  i would much prefer to have bonded composite fillings in my own mouth as there are many more advantages to them you and other readers should be aware that they are usally more costly and many insurance companies will not pay for the additional cost on posterior (or back) teeth  which is unfortunate
1309,as as dr fleming stated  you would be better off having any surgery to your upper and lower jaws first  then the rhinoplasty are you sure you need jaw surgery? have you consulted with an oral surgeon? an orthodontist? it appears you may need a team to work with you to get things just right consult with them first hope this info helps
1310,symptoms = surgery symptomatic gallstones are an indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy not an emergency but don't wait forever

1312,you you should go back to see your dentist the proper name for a temporary crown is a provisional restoration it is meant to test your tooth  gums  and environment prior to the final crown unless surgery was done  this should feel totally normal please call your dentist and inform him or her about the symptoms if the pain persists  you might have problems with the final work as well best of luck  dr zev kaufman
1313,yes the glands are lymph nodes which are part of your body's defense mechanism when fighting off infection  they may swell up and become tender the location of the sores you mention and the swelling of the glands leads me to suspect that you might be having an episode of herpes in conjunction with the aphthous ulcers you might want to see your dentist or family md for an evaluation feel better
1314,certain certain local anesthetics can have a duration of action of 6 to 8 hours depending on the site of injection these long acting anesthetics are routinely used in third molar surgery to provide extended relief from surgical pain if the anesthesia remains the morning after the surgery it may indicate that the nerve in the area may have been disturbed this is a known consequence associated with the removal of the lower third molars and can result from stretching  compressing or tearing of the nerve stretching and compression injuries have better prognosis for recovery  though it may take several months for full sensation to return thought injuries typically do not require further treatment  just monitoring injuries that involve transection of the nerve can be permanent it is these types of injuries that may require further surgical treatment no matter the cause  prolonged anesthesia  greater than a day  require follow-up by the treating surgeon
1315,can't can't tell if you are infected  but from your description it sounds like you have an open cantact in that area the open contact can be caused by teeth shat have shifted  a loose or defective filling  or a cavity the food you are eating is getting impacted between the teeth  irritating the gum tissue  and causing it to swell a bit probably bleeding and sore due to the pressure floss and brush to clean it out  then a little salt water and/or mouthwash brushed into the area to help reduce bacterial count see your dentist to have it corrected  since left untreated it can not only be annoying  but the inflammation can result in localized bone loss and periodontal pocketing also  take otc analgesics to relieve pain and reduce inflammation
1316,are are we sure this is a lymph node? an isolated lymph node in the suboccipital area would be unusual unless there were inflammatory/infectious processes of the posterior scalp skin or very rarely spread of skin cancers did it appear at the time of your other symptoms or has it possibly been present for some time and you now just noticed it sebaceous cysts (blocked oil glands) or small lipomas (fatty tumors-benign) can be mistaken for a lymph node if it persists beyond 3-4 weeks it would be reasonable to have it looked at if it remains swollen and tender (not usually a characteristic of a malignant lymph node) a course of appropriate antiobiotics and short term oral steroids wouldn't be inappropriate
1317,forget the nurses for a second  you need to follow up with the doc and get a follow up x-ray there are two issues here - the break  and the possibility the sore created a new problem such as a possible deeper infection you did not state how you broke the foot or if you have comorbidities like diabetesfollow up with a doc

1324,gingival tattoo sometimes in the process of doing a silver amalgam filling  small pieces of the excess filling can become embedded in the gum tissue  creating what your describing the area is not swollen  but is purplish and is close to the filling it is not dangerous  but if you find it effects your esthetics see a periodontists
1325,this this is commonly called temporomandibular joint disorder  or tmd (some say tmj  but that just describes the joint  and not the problem) sometimes the disc that the joint uses gets out of alignment and it can be painful to move the jaw try 800 mg ibuprofen 3 times per day for 3 days if that doesn't do the trick  see your dentist if they have tmd experience  they can help  and if not  they should be able to give an appropriate referral you may need oral appliance therapy

1453,not likely lymph nodes in the neck enlarge for lots of reasons often it's infection  sometimes immunizations if they're small (< 1/2) they may just be scarred from a previous infection cancer may grow slowly   but typically if they were cancerous nodes they would have clearly enlarged over 5 months with no treatment

1548,see below get rechecked for worsening of the asthma or development of a pneumonia
1549,vascular the cold sounds like an impingement of the circulation   but an exam by a podiatrist is indicated
1550,my thoughts do you really have diagnostically proven ms or is this merely a possible concern? yes  lesions on mri films do indeed change  but never disappear  and over time increase in size and quantity if effective medication is not employed would encourage a visit to a neurologist to get all of this clarified
1551,unlikely ms you probably possess a peripheral neuropathy secondary to either diabetes or other causes this needs an assessment from a neurologist  who is experienced in the varying types of peripheral nerve disorders
1552,yes  valuable tool at this time the 1 5 tesla mri is the most commonly used image to assess and evaluate ms the 30 tesla may pickup more lesions  but does not provide significantly better clinical diagnostic accuracy
1553,unusual normally when we see red lower legs its associated with pain from cellulitis or circulation  may be allergic reaction to something see your doctor
1554,wisdom tooth the answer you are probably expecting is to see yor dentist or an oral surgeon and schedule to have wisdom teeth removed based on your description you should probably be on antibiotics as soon as possible you will feel much better once the teeth are removed and this will no longer be something you have to worry about
1555,depends depends on the knee surgery and how your knee is feeling
1556,yes  it can of course over-studying and under-sleeping can lead to headache  nervousness  and dizziness anxiety makes the sleeplessness worse  and vice versa you also need to make sure not to use stimulants (caffeine  amphetamines  etc) because they will worsen your state establish regular sleep/wake times even on weekends exercise  even just a walk around the block see doctor if symptoms persist

1559,depends it is possible to have normal tsh levels  and it is also possible to have abnormal tsh levels benign nodules may or may not change in size anytime there is a change in nodule size (especially a rapid growth) anywhere on the body  it's good to have it reevaluated by a doctor
1560,mammogramssavelives your answer is right here--do the math the radiation exposure of a digital mammogram is 37mgy this is associated with a lifetime-attributable risk of breast cancer of 13 cases per 100  000 the lifetime incidence of breast cancer in us women is 1:8 mammography is a safe  proven technique for finding cancers well before they are palpable and there is no controversy about its use after age 50
1561,polyclonal polyclonal gammopathy are usually related to chronic inflammation  chronic diseases  autoimmune disorders etc - and usually not due to blood malignancy
1562,possibly if the pain is in the area where your wisdom teeth are erupting  then it is probably due to the inflammation
1563,you need to work up to the max dose over time as you probably know lyrica is another option see a pain specialist if you can't get relief  they may suggest a spinal stimulator trail
1564,therapy you can try ibuprofen over the counter and physical therapy as a first line treatment of a herniated disk without surgery if you fail therapy and your pain persists  you may need surgery try to do physical therapy first williams and mckenzie exercises help quite a bit
1565,sounds like it sounds like ringworm if it is raised on the edges and has central clearing  it probably is this is caused by a dermatophyte and can be treated with anti-fungal cream
1566,good idea do the trial then implant i if it works  has out performed revision surgery in studies no reason to think a fifth surgery would be helpful burning pain could be permanent nerve damage with no structural solution blocking the transmission of afferent impulses makes sense to me
1567,soooo nodule is not a diagnosis it is a description of a finding on a study really need to know what kind of nodule there are several types of nodules that are completely benign he would not have told you all was well unless i really was doctors are generally very conservative if her doc said not to worry why do you continue to worry? maybe you should talk to them again
1568,neurology i would stick with the neurologist
1569,asthma these are common symptoms in asthma exacerbations of all degrees and should prompt you to seek medical attention
1570,no get help this behavior is only going to lead you down a darker road all of these substances mess up your neurotransmitters the first thing you need to do is to seek professional help to get detoxed ie get your brain dried out oce what we call a baseline is established what other steps are needed can be determined you need d&a therapy & individual & if appropriate family &conjoint [preferred other]
1571,recurrent tmj/tmd is very common tmd is the second most frequent cause of orofacial pain after dental pain it can be divided into disorders related to the muscles of mastication and those emanating from the tmj earache and head pressure are common symptoms due to the close location to tmj rec: orofacial pain practitioner for diagnosis
1572,add w/reduction this could be anterior disc displacement with reduction  a temporomandibular joint disorder your eustacion tube is directly behind this joint and extreme pressure from the joint can cause abnormal hearing  usually it is more of a stuffy feeling in your ear canal i would not consider this permanent  unless you never addressed the tmjd
1573,high risk evaluation i recommend you seek out a high risk breast program or specialist to do an extensive family history to determine when and what type of screening is indicated
1574,multiple symptoms based upon your symptoms you should be seen by a periodontist  general dentist  orthopedic surgeon and a primary care physician or ent start with your worst symptom and see the appropriate doctor
1575,u should be seen asthmatics should have two medications 1- the brown one  (most likely qvar he should be doing it twice a day always  to help eliminate exacerbations 2- the blue one is for when he is sick and to help open up his lungs 3- if he is having trouble he needs to be seen immediately  he may need oral steroids he is either not doing the med right or not enough
1576,possibilities: while i rarely take iliac crest bone graft because it usually isn't necessary  when i do  my patients never complain of pain from the graft site it definitely could be si joint pain  you should have your si joint evaluated with the 5 provocative tests for si instability if at least 3 are positive  then an si joint injection  radioablation  or minimally invasive fusion may alleviate your pain
1577,not likely the scope is sterilized between patients so transmission is unlikely colonoscopy is fairly safe and great screening tool for colon cancer
1578,it should you had a lot of work completed in a small  confined space not unusual for the tissue to be sore and feel tight as the healing process begins
1579,depression there are a lot of antidepressants that are not addictive i would recommend seeing a doctor about the depression although not addictive  there are some that you should not just stop taking  all at once
1580,allergic rhinitis this time of year it looks like you are allergic to trees and/or grasses which are giving you symptoms of an allergic nose the runny nose is giving you a post nasal drip which is irritating and making you cough
1581,calf pain is the calf hot  red  swollen? you may have a venous blood clot or an infection of the skin both should be checked out at once for proper diagnosis & treatment
1582,see md may need biopsy to find out what it is
1583,absolutely you have endocarditis and need to be seen and treated by infectious diseases experts asap echocardiography  even if done at its best  does not exclude the diagnosis and you have most of the criteria there are many cases of culture-negative endocarditis if you are not being seen by an id expert you need to do that now there are serologic studies to identify organisms (like coxiella burnetti)
1584,contact surgeon numbness after this type of procedure is a rare complication  but it happens nonetheless have you discussed this with your surgeon? if not  now is the time to call
1585,foot pain try resting it (for 1-2 weeks)  icing  compressing wraps or bracing  and elevating your rolled ankle take otc antiinflammatory drugs like advil or motrin as directed by the manufacturer to help if clicking or feeling of ripping or instability  get it checked out by a foot doctor (podiatrist) hope this was helpful  if so please vote for me thanks!
1586,not usually these are usually symptoms of impending menses but can be seen with early pregnancy much depends on your menstrual pattern  but if you are pregnant  a home test will show it by 7-10 days from the missed period
1587,x-ray you need to be sure this is only a sprain and not a fracture get an x-ray and if no fracture then a lace up brace  otherwise you need to see an orthopedic surgeon
1588,nerve the pinky numbness could be an irritated or pinched nerve at the elbow or in the forearm (called cubital tunnel syndrome) however  if it seems to be starting at the shoulder it could be caused by a similar process in the armpit area (brachial plexus) or in the neck some vitamin deficiencies can cause nerve related pain (neuropathy) you should see your doctor
1589,headache who is weaning u off klonopin and why were u on it in the first place? my guess is ur headache is related to this but u should probably call ur doc
1590,possibilities several possible causes include infection (bacterial or viral)  cancer  allergies  or injury it is impossible to know without examining the spots you need to have a dentist examine the roof of your mouth to determine what the spots are  so see your dentist
1591,call and get checked there is still healing going on  but at this point you should not have much pain everyone is different you said that you only took antibiotics for 4 days thie typical prescription for most antibiotics is 7 to 10 days so you may not have taken enough to kills the infection if you still have significant pain or swelling it is best to call your oral surgeon and get this area checked
1592,could be either there is a lot of overlap between premenstrual symptoms and early pregnancy symptoms even light bleeding around the time of an expected period can occur with pregnancy a home pregnancy test and/or a blood test at your doctor's office may help clear things up after testing  if you are pregnant or still have unexplained symptoms consult your doctor
1593,not right something is not right the simplest explanation is that you are getting food in your lung  you need evaluation for that by a speech pathologist certainly  that is not the only possible reason
1594,all good options the options you mention are good and in the right order to use! (flexeril requires a prescription) if you didn't sustain an injury  it is likely tight neck muscles due to overuse range of motion exercises can help as well if it does not improve with over the counter medications soon consult your physician
1595,anemia looks like you are anemic  many things can cause that  including internal bleeding and chronic diseases wtih chest pain  you should always see a doctor right away to make sure you aren't having a heart attack call your doctor or go to the hospital
1596,normal  in context though the t4 & the free (direct) t4 levels are at the lower limit of normal range  do not put too much emphasis on it the t4 (and  therefore  the free t4) levels can vary a bit during the course of the day remember  these are hormones  and so there is some variation depending on how much the gland is putting out and the body is using that instant the tsh is your better guide  and it's normal
1597,no extensive workup  especially given age if everything is ok anatomically  and no abnormal cardiac rhythm  consider non cardiac causes
1598,good question! mammograms are of limited benefit in your 20's & not routinely ordered i advise you to see a breast surgeon to help put all these puzzle pieces together something is not adding up based on the info you are providing--a benign-appearing intramammary ln usually requires no further evaluation if anything  a directed ultrasound may corroborate these findings & allow easier follow-up
1599,rest  ice & elevate! some swelling after surgery is normal the amount and location may not be the type of surgery is important  but post-op care is a very big factor simple ice and elevation with range of motion exercises when called for can prevent or reduce swelling sometimes rest alone with elevation of the feet to eye level for several days will do it joint surgery usually requires motion to heal properly
1600,3-4 days i usually recommend a soft diet for 2-3 days following extraction but this depends on the extraction itself each peson heals differently so after a couple of days you can start eating foods that you can tolerate avoid hard chewy  chrunchy  and spicy foods until you are feeling better
1601,depends it does depend on the strength of the tooth generally if a tooth has a root canal it had multiple fillings before this possibly a fracture -it is compromised already even after all the time and financial commitments of restoring  the chances of that tooth surviving 3 -5 years is not great then you are back to getting an implant i try not to pay for things twice  but it is a decision between you
1602,problems still swelling is the tissue response to an injury or infection i would check with your dentist to see which of these exists the clicking indicates you have a problem inside the joint and since the back of the joint shares structures with the ear  there may be a relationship there as well that will require a more comprehensive evaluation and treatment as tmj problems don't cure themselves
1603,please don't play most likely your ankle is sprained it needs time to heal i know you probably like to play soccer a lot  but if you play now while your ankle is still healing there is a very good chance that you will hurt it worse and it will take longer to heal i would not play soccer for 1-2 weeks that way you can play later in the summer without a problem
1604,see an orthopedist and do this asap you could have blood in the joint space  may have torn ligaments or tendons and this needs to be examined  diagnosed and treated by an expert see an orthopedic surgeon soon  and good luck
1605,tight chest/ throat most cough with sore throat for few days are viral tight chest could mean asthma or bronchospasm or simply chest pain because of coughing   so i would suggest you to see a dr if you are asthmatic you need to use your bronchodilators the decision to use or not antibiotics is up the treating physician when there is a question for bacterial infections
1606,unlikely unlikely  but a 2nd opinion might be helpful
1607,check it out when in doubt you should check it out it is also important to try to determine why you became faint
1608,maybe the important thing is to make sure you are not having symptoms that could indicate bleeding inside the brain if you have unusual sleepiness  nausea  trouble walking straight  or anything else that is abnormal for you  you should see your doctor at once you might need further tests in most cases  though  your headache will go away and you'll be fine maybe a quieter party next year!
1609,doubtful tingling and numbness are not typical symptoms of tmd i would recommend that you see a dentist to address all your dental issues and evaluate your tmjoints  etc i am assuming that you are under the care of a physician for the polyneuropathy who can address the medical issues
1610,sciatica possibility what you describe could be sciatic nerve pain you should get it checked if it doesn't get better many possibilities can cause these symptoms
1611,no & maybe hcg should only be present in someone who is pregnant +hcg weeks before menses could indicate an early pregnancy  there are also uncommon tumors of the ovary that can cause +hcg levels in patient who are not pregnant (a couple of other very rare conditions can cause also) and  lastly  people who use hcg administration for weight loss will have + levels in their system
1612,see below it is possible that the cough is from a cold often the cough is due to nasal secretions and good irrigation may help if symptoms continue or worsen you should return to your doctor as the cold can progress you should be concerned if baby develops fever  flaring of the nostrils  very fast breathing  or pulling in of the ribs with breathing
1613,also consider lice! in my area it is an epidemic among grade school aged children if you're around any children  it might be worth combing through your hair with a lice comb to see if any of the little buggers are there if so treat for lice and you're cured! andlice prefer clean hair to dirty hair so this suggestion is no judgment on you!
1614,good idea typically recommend baseline at 35 in women who have first degree relative (mother) with breast cancer or  begin routine screening at 10 years younger than the age of the youngest relative w breast cancer at their age of diagnosis usually  will not screen with mammograms yearly in women younger than 30
1615,? bite the concern about infection expressed by the other doctors is correct but the itchiness makes me wonder if it is a bug bitesee your doctor
1616,you didnt inform us how the injury occured which would help nonetheless  i would recommend you see a foot doc who may decide to order an mri depending on their clinical findings important things to know would be is there any motion restriction? loss of power? in theory something could of ruptured
1617,initially ice packs ice packs if you feel the swelling is getting worse the cold will reduce the amount of blood going into your tissue causing bleeding once the internal bleeding has stopped  then warm packs to help move the excess blood away from the swollen site
1618,malocclusion malocclusion between the upper and lower teeth is the most likely explanation this can also be related to tmj and bruxism which may explain the night time symptoms your dentist or oral surgeon can help
1619,so sorry this is a very bad situation  and really not compatible with life beyond 2 or 3 months at most once the liver gets involved  and out of control  there is little intervention which would succeed might consider hospice care at this point all the best through this difficult time
1620,pl see your dentist antibiotics will only help so much the tooth needs to be evaluated by a dentist please inform that you are on warfarin as it might need to be stopped for a few days if the tooth needs to be extracted
1621,blood in stool blood in stool is always an issue of concern it may be that you have a hemorrhoid  but see your doctor for evaluation he may want to refer you to a gastroenerologist for further evaluation
1622,depends there is such a thing as non-celiac gluten sensitivity also possibility of other food problems would do a comprehensive digestive and stool analysis  which also checks for bad bugs and yeast and other things
1623,no no
1624,does not predict rather  an mri shows what did or did not occur in past instead pay attention to the true risk factors  such as smoking  hypertension  high triglycerides  hyprhomocysteinemia  prior heart disease  diabetes mellitus
1625,therapy ready for ? medications prescribed? please clarify

2059,symptomatic if you don't have gout or active arthritis  then quite likely you have nerve pain for that  you can try several things: such as liniments  lidoderm patches  or anticonvulsants--which are good for chronic nerve pain
2060,this can be due to either a fungus or a bacteria the key is do not pull at any of the peeling skin as this could cauase a bad infection you can try a topical antifungal agent if using creams better to use them at night so as when you walk it does not cause skin chafing betadine solution painted with a q tip is another option
2061,removal of the sourc many times chronic infections of the upper jaw (maxilla) and sinus area are associated with infected molar teeth whose roots can extend into the sinus area your local oral and maxillofacial surgeon should be able to perform several radiographic 3 dimensional studies to pinpoint the source of the infection if so  remove it and replace with a dental implant
2062,possible generally  superficial veins are not the ones that cause a deep vein thrombosis but anything is possible i would work with your medical doctor and have it evaluated you may need to see a vascular doctor for further treatment
2063,hopefully not! most patients with arthritis lead quite functional lives a number may have modest functional damage  but keep working! but i have patients with trivial problems  who want to drop out because of a diagnosis! most are not and will not become disabled!
2064,depends nucynta is a newer drug for people with a true narcotic allergy which is relatively rare it's a schedule 2  so similar to percocet/oxycodone in strength dosage depends partially on your tolerance to pain meds is  so someone with a history of a lot of paineds will need a higher dose that someone who hasn't taken much that said  average dosing is 50-100mg every 4-6hrs as needed for pain
2065,maybe both but usually when sinuses get infected the upper teeth become sore  the infection in the sinus can creat pressure which can push against the root of the teeth hence the sensitivity and soreness the rest of your question i hope an md can answer! hope you feel better soon!
2066,it depends full recovery after knee replacement usually takes more than a year most patients reduce their use of pain medicines within two weeks of the replacement  by 6 weeks they are comfortable and usually by 3 months the knee is fading into the background  and life doesn't revolve around the new knee everyone is different and this is a general time line if you are concerned tell your doctor
2067,you need to visit your internist  for a complete history and physical blood work sounds like a good idea as well do you take medications? any medical conditions? cramping in legs at night? or while walking? there are more questions that need to be answeredto help you
2068,see a breast doctor majority of the breast lumps are benign like beast cysts an ultrasound in addition to mammogra can help determine if a lump is a solid or a cystic lump cysts are almost always benign and sometimes they are painful solid lumps can be benign or cancerous after you had your mammogram you definitely need to see a doctor  preferably a breast specialst even if your mammogram report was negative
2069,second opinion? if the tooth was extracted 2 months ago  primary healing should be well underway if the adjacent teeth now hurt  you may have a secondary problem return to your dentist  or consider getting a second opinion no one should be upset or offended by that  and sometimes fresh eyes are good
2070,spotting sounds like low progesterone spotting before your period keep a menstrual diary and see if it gets normal next cycle if it persists  you may need a progesterone boost other things cause spotting like polyps  fibroids and infections and always consider pregnancy if it's a possibility
2071,evaluate for blood c any time you have surgery you are at risk for a clot in the deep veins(deep venous thrombosis) you have already had one so you may be prone to another swelling in the leg would be a symptom this should be evaluated with a vascular ultrasound asap
2072,possible possible but not not likely it usually takesore exposure than that
2073,copd? sounds like your cancer is cured  congratulations  you are one of few! you probably smoked and this lingering bronchitis may be uncontrolled copd check with your doctor for bronchodilators +/- steroids radiation pneumonitis would be very unusual after all this time
2074,checked for strep? a person with tonsillitis can be checked for strep throat at her doctor's office if there is strep  antibiotics are needed (usually amoxicillin) after 3 days or so  she should be well enough to gradually begin exercising again if her symptoms are viral and start improving after 3 days  she should be able to gradually resume exercising then too
2075,i would suggest you see an ent doctor and a neurologist ent's can do special barium swallowing studies by speech pathology to detect subtle functional swallowing issues a neuroloist might explore myasthenia gravis  although pain does not fit that
2076,lump being scared is a normal feeling however  do not let the fear take over your life if no strong family history of breast/ovarian cancer  having a normal mammo and sono are sufficient and they should put your mind on ease f/u with your md and have annual clinical breast exam and you can also do self breast checkbut  if you are at high risk-strong family history-mri need to be considered d/w md
2077,symptom free & ur ok has urine been check microscopically or a catheter specimen? that should have been next step was urinalysis repeated when u had the cystoscopy? urine dipstick will show falsely positive for wbcs from vaginal epithelial cells now you are clear after possible overinvestigation i do not think you need anything other than a repeat urine test with microscopy in 3 months consider another dr
2078,pillow there is no physical reason preventing you from sleeping on your side you might try a pillow between your legs if you find it uncomfortable while your knee recovers
2079,yes first very close follow up by the oncologist  preventing osteoporosis  zometa will help ske ( skeletal related events   like fractures joint and muscle problems ) in 40%   risk of metastasis in 14 %   speak to your oncologist
2080,must r/o herpes it can present that way   see your gyn today for an exam and gyn can do cultures to seeif it is that or anything else and u can get started on txmemt for whatever your gyn thinks it is while your gyn is waiting for the cultures to come back  that is what i do with my pts
2081,not typical ms firstly mri is imaging of choice for ms  not ct secondly  symptoms you describe are very non-specific head tension and popping ears are definitely atypical if it's not ms  what does your neurologist think it is? if you don't get a satisfactory answer  get a second opinion
2082,see doc there are many treatments  including a new one with the name daliresp
2083,it depends it would have to be a quite severe fracture to need an amputation these days an external fixator can be put on to allow healing of most comminuted really awful fractures then revisional surgery is done later only fractures that cut off the blood supply to the foot or have a nasty infection would need an amputation
2084,normal swelling swelling may stll be present in the palm it is not unusual for the palm to still fell a little bit full or tight the normal indentation or inverted v that on sees when you look at your palm in profile may be absent some also feel a pulling sensation when the extend their wrists and it can feel like forearm tightness gentle stretching and massage can be helpful too
2085,probably if you have a complex tear of the medial meniscal cartilage  then it usually does not heal on its own limited range of motion can occur when the cartilage is broken or flipped out of position if your pain persist  you will probably need endoscopic surgery ask your doctor for a referral to an orthopedic doctor
2086,ask neck surgeon your neck surgeon has the definitive answer based on your actual surgery  as well as how your healing has progressed an elective cosmetic surgery should not be undertaken when there is any risk to your neck; your neck will likely need to be hyperextended for anesthesia  and unless fully and durably healed (x-ray?)  this could be a major risk talk frankly with your neck surgeon about your plan!
2087,no not at all derms agree that topical vitamin e may cause a contact dermatitis and it has no anti acne effects
2088,depends you should see your doctor there is no way to tell what is going on without a physical exam and a thorough history 
2089,neck evaluation a ponched nerve in your neck can do this c6 nerve root can do this that would bbe a disc herniation at c5-6
2090,possibilties yes  you can experience diplopia from multiple sclerosis  brainstem strokes  and myasthenia gravis  and all can be sorted out by an expert neurologist a number of diagnostic tests can readily sort out these disorders  and confirm causation
2091,consider chest ct you need to talk to your doctor about ways to stop smoking  which is a known cause of lung cancer that's the 1st thing you need to do a negative chest x-ray does not mean your lungs are free of disease assuming the mris were of your spine  consider an optimized screening chest ct to determine the status of your lungs and reduce your anxiety
2092,you need to be re-evaluated by your physician you should check the report of the mammogram  don't assume anything incidentally  federal mqsa regulations require that a patient be notified  in writing  of mammo results within 30 days if you didn't get a letter  your facility may not be in compliance with the law
2093,a lot depends on where the break is at if it is not into a joint  there should be little worry about displacement or not  based in the information you gave from two other doctors no surgery now!
2094,spinal issue? hand and feet nerve symptoms can manifest themselves during activity and/or rest in your case  it might be the loading vertically of the spine when sitting that causes the lumbar and brachial plexus to be compressed  causing a nerve entrapment seek out a spinal surgeon or neurologist for more definitive testing and examination
2095,depends every situation is different some wisdom teeth are bony impacted  some are infection or abcessed it also depends on the type and size of the bone graft being compared to it is difficult to provide a comparison
2096,not carpal tunnel first off the description is of physical characteristics which is something distinct from symptoms symptoms of carpal tunnel would typically be related to entrapment of the median nerve ie numbness  tingling and weakness of the hand i'm not aware that this occurs to any greater degree in someone with long fingers though a thin wrist might certainly predispose to compression of the nerve
2097,it is possible certainly  you have symptoms that sound very ms like but  i cannot say for sure without more info  an exam and mris of your brain/neck
2098,possible bakers cyst as well as nerve entrapment see an orthopedist
2099,allergic reaction you could be allergic to medication  food  perfume  something in soap or lotion see physician
2100,varies recovery from an ankle sprain is highly variable it depends on the degree of ligament tearing  the need and compliance with immobilization (boot  cast  brace)  compliance with relative rest and the success with rehab at times  occult ( hard to diagnose) fractures or bone bruising create longer recovery periods average full recovery from a typical sprain is 1-2 months
2101,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
2102,yes the first thing you should have is a ultrasound of your leg to evaluate for a deep venous thrombosis (dvt) this is a painless and quick test  but very important let your primary care doctor know
2103,most likely! yes  most likely with the mri and a chest xray  if there is any cause for your symptoms  it would most likely identify  any lesion more than 3-5mm in the chest or the spine i am sure your doc would be able to help you once ha has all the results
2104,yes  it can this is why women are encouraged to do a self exam regularly  like every month or so it can still be benign  but cancer must be ruled out mammograms at a certain age are also very important for the same reason so the next step is to see your doctor to get this examined with tests  and the like  to find out exactly what this is
2105,yes most plastic surgeons feel comfortable performing breast augmentation surgery while patients remain on birth control medications however  although controversial  some plastic surgeons are also concerned about the potential for deep venous thrombosis (clots)  which may be a greater risk for patients who are on certain types of oral contraceptives
2106,see your doc you should report this lump to your doctor asap
2107,bad headache the answer would depend largely on how long have you had this type of headache if this is a pattern you have had for many years  then the chances of some type oof pathology are low if it is a very recent onset  then it should be investigated by a qulified headache specialist
2108,read below breast cancer can progress or recur in case chemotherapy is not working well against cancer ct scan is the best way to look for cancer in the lungs and liver but it can only show shadows which often require further tests either a biopsy or a pet scan if there is any uncertainty about the cause of the shadows sometimes radiotherapy can cause shadows on the lungsso not all shadows are mets
2109,strep throat if sore throat and fever are only symptoms you have  the chance of strep throat is high need to see your pcp
2110,might be a ganglion if you notice a localized area of swelling in the ball of the foot  it might be a ganglionic cyst  bursa  or neuroma impingement on the nerve can cause numbness usually in congestive heart failure  swelling looks more generalized in the feet  ankles and legs if you press on the swelling  and it leaves a dent  that is fluid retention and might be due to your heart
2111,sometimes when a child's anemia reaches levels where therapeutic iron is needed  cramps & constipation are seen occasionally full srength juices will sometimes counter the effect it is not seen from the iron content of regular formulas
2112,no no  it sounds like viral  do symptomatic therapy  give pedialyte for fluids  if baby feels ok  not lethargic  drinks fluids  wets dipers as usual  fever below 104  and still active do not worry  you might still want to bring baby to pediatrician to check and make sure that no prescriptions needed if fever is below 101 and baby is active and tolerating it let it run
2113,consult oncologist! for estrogen or progesterone positive receptor cancer of breast: hormone manipulation: estrogen receptor inhibitors-tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors-arimidex  aromasin  letrosole etc !
2114,yes it is possible yes bacteria could have accumulated below the gum line while the tooth was coming in and caused the cavity to occur
2115,tingling after ctr very normal to have tingling after carpal tunnel surgery! it usually represents swelling in the immediate area of the nerve elevate the hands whenever possible and as the swelling decreases  so should the tingling! best of luck!
2116,consider fixing it there are procedures to fix damaged ligaments and also to decompress an entrapped nerve
2117,scaphoid fracture numbness may be the result of awkward positioning or a tight cast or splint if present contact your doctor for instructions re: loosening the cast or splint sometimes people can develop carpal tunnel syndrome following an injury rarely direct nerve injury from several causes may be the culprit discuss your symptoms with your treating physician for proper evaluation and treatment
2118,increased risk using combined hormone therapy after menopause increases the risk of getting breast cancer it may also increase the chances of dying from breast cancer this increase in risk can be seen with as little as 2 years of use combined ht also increases the likelihood that the cancer may be found at a more advanced stage
2119,yes exercise is important to maintaining many aspects of health walking is typically well tolerated by an artificial joint use common sense to guide your initial efforts start slowly and add duration/distance in small increments
2120,robert j spinner robert j spinner at the mayo clinic is the national expert in peripheral nerve injury and nerve reconstruction
2121,endoscopic or open? it depends if you had the traditional open decompression  then that is normal on average  it takes 3 to 6 months to fully heal if you had it done endoscopically like i do it  with no incision on the hand  then most are fully back to work without restrictions within a few days  and fully healed in a few weeks so in short  it depends mostly on who did your surgery  and how it was done
2122,not long at all some patients may have discomfort for the first day other patients may be a few days depends on how smooth the procedure went  if the tooth was infected and the patient (if there are any medical issues)
2123,see your dentist you should return the dentist who performed your surgery for evaluation and determination of the cause of the recurring infection x-rays or additional studies may be performed and depending on the findings  a minor surgical procedure may also be required to resolve the problem
2124,many asthma  anxiety  fibromyalgia  systemic diseases  bead through check up
2125,get checked get checked for autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis  sjögren's syndrome  scleroderma  lupus  etc  see a rheumatologist they will examine you and order appropriate tests if needed
2126,sure you might do better with stable methadone 5 mg 2x-3x a day this should keep a stable blood level of pain medicine rather than the up and down plasma level of vicodin
2127,swollen gum if it gets worse or she has a fever call your doctor and dentist they can help you make sure it's not an abcess or infection
2128,only aspirin daily only aspirin is indicated for prevention of heart attack acetaminophen and ibuprophen are not used and not recommended for prevention of heart attack
2129,not likely mvp typically doesn't cause too many problems in an otherwise healthy person if there is an underlying heart problem or other disease process at work  then all bets are off while it may be associated with it  the mvp isn't likely to be the direct cause
2130,cyst or drainage? these do sometimes track pretty far down the leg it could certainly be the cyst itself if it remains on the posterior aspect of the leg another possibility is that it has caused some pressure on one of the large veins behind the knee causing swelling at both the leg in the ankle i would see an orthopedic surgeon to help make a diagnosis and guide treatment
2131,absolutely saline irrigation of the nose is safe and effective i encourage all my nasal allergy patients to rinse their nose there are also non=allergic forms of nasal disease as well as chronic sinusitis  where nasal irrigation is crucial
2132,abdominal exam first the obvious concern is to first rule out an ovarian cancer- with a good gyn and abdominal exam  ct  and ca-125 tumor marker with personal history of breast cancer before 38 and mother with ovarian  brca testing should be done treatments options will follow from there and may include removal of ovaries and uterus  prophylactic mastectomy and/or close surveillance
2133,i would think if you do they are 2 separate problems
2134,yes and no loosing blood from an extraqction can be monitored and stopped with pressure internal bleeding can go unnoticed and can be life threatening i am not sure what information you are looking for in your question hope this info helps
2135,probably teething it depends where the areas in the mouth are from the description it looks like teething you can have a pediatric dentist take a look to make sure that everything is fine
2136,depends it would be great if the answer was a definitive yes and  though the way you describe it  it seems likely  but it depends on the type of cancer  the extent of involvement  and the size of metastases also  if there are obscuring findings  like a diffuse pneumonia  it might be difficult to pick up on x-ray
2137,yes  yes  it is too early for you to get a mammogram at this age  focus on self breast exams and familiarize yourself with the way your breasts feel so that you can notice if a lump develops in the future mammograms in young females are often extremely difficult to interpret because the breast tissue is so dense it hides most lesions screening for breast cancer using mammography starts at age 40 if you have a sister or mother who were diagnosed with breast cancer when they were younger than 50 years of age  then screening with breast mri and genetic testing may be indicated
2138,varies w individual every person is different in how they perceive pain most will be sore for 3 days to 2 weeks same is true for work your are completely healed around 6 weeks you should avoid upper body excercises for at least 6 weeks brignonimdcom
2139,no data no data to support taking a vaccine in your 50s especially after having already contracted hpv

2141,chronic chronic ear fluid is a common problem for a lot of kids because the eustachian tube (the tube that drains the ear into the throat) is narrow and winding in kids  it can often stop draining properly and cause chronic fluid or frequent ear infections the good news is that as children grow  the tubes grow also becoming wider and straighter to allow for proper drainage for most adults the bad news is that this doesn't happen overnight since there are no medications shown to alleviate the pressure or drain the fluid from behind the ear drum  it has to be done with a suction and/or ear tubes you can try giving motrin or tylenol for the ear discomfort  but the fluid will either have to drain out on its own (unlikely given your son's history) or drain out when the tube is placed legal disclaimer: i am providing this general and basic information as a public service and my response to this question does not constitute a doctor-patient relationship for any additional information  advice  or specific concerns  please speak with your own physician the information provided is current as of the date of the answer entry
2142,venous ultrasound yes  there are many causes of leg swelling a venous ultrasound of the legs done by a vein specialist can rule out vein disease and then you can move on heaviness  swelling  restless legs etc can result from venous reflux  backward flow of blood backwards down the legs with prolonged standing and sitting due to inherited valve disorder can be treated in office procedures wwwphlebologyorg
2143,95% 95% of patients having elective cholecystectomy in my practice do not require urinary catheterization the procedure is usually short  less than 30 minutes and muscle relaxants usually wear off rapidly obviating urinary retention the exceptions are usually elderly males with prostate enlargement and most of these patients are able to void prior to discharge using and in and out bladder drainage procedure
2144,another another you can and should take in consideration is a ligament injury for a precise evaluation go talk to a hand surgeon he or she may suggest a mri which can help confirm the injury
2145,here are some  clinically  i agree with my colleague stating musculoskeletal origin as a culprit for pain as described for a 91-year-old man  bring the detailed info on his voiding history and pain near left hip & lower back stressing their quality  quantity  and sequence of events over time to doc for analysis  physical exam  & tests such as residual urine  urinalysis  renal function  etc so to define cause
2146,examination sounds like sinusitis you can try over the counter decongestants and ibuprofen the dizzy is due to the inner ear adjacent to the sinuses being affected
2147,cts carpal tunnel syndrome is number one on the list
2148,probably not i agree with drs hansen and d ipl might work for very fine spider veins but if your veins are bulging  you are liekly to be disappointed with the results you get from ipl i would recommend seeing a vein specialist (phlebologist) who can evaluate your legs to make sure that there is no undersying vein trouble if there isn't  then smaller veins can probably best be treated with sclerotherapy
2149,possibly asthma is recurrent episodes of bronchospasm and airway inflammation it is possible for these episodes to occur only with infections
2150,bakers cyst? if you have a swelling in back of your knee  it isa very common place for a cyst to form see your orthopedist for evaluation and treatment
2151,pediatrician how about starting with your child's pediatrician? he or she is likely to be very experienced in treating eczema in children as this is a very common skin problem if your pediatrician feels it is medically necessary  he/she may subsequently refer you to a dermatologist if necessary
2152,arrhythmia mitral valve prolapse is typically asymptomatic by itself but can be associated with some abnormal heart rhythms which can be symptomatic
2153,hard to say one white spot on brain mri is nonspecific if it is in a particular area (corpus callosum) it would be more concerning  otherwise it could have been from prior brain infection (encephalitis) or trauma (shearing injury) your symptoms are a bit more worrisome perhaps a spinal fluid analysis will help neurology consult would be useful
2154,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells/digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph everywhere for bad stuff like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
2155,thin chest wall if he has a thin chest well he may be feeling his heart hitting up against his chest wall like a ping pong ball nothing serious
2156,you will need all breast cancer in stage 2 still needs a lumpectomy and nodal evaluation which is surgery afterward chemo and radiation is often recommended
2157,everyone's everyone's body reacts differently  however most people have significant discomfort/pain for about 2 days  then begin to improve i have seen some patients be quite painful for a week be sure to use the medications as prescribed for pain and you will most likely do well
2158,depends patients taking bisphosphonates for osteoporosis are at greater risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw from surgical procedures the injectables or iv meds are most likely to cause problems the oral meds are not as bad for complications  your dr may take you off reclast for a period of time before the extraction please discuss this w your physician and oral surgeon! good luck!
2159,yes new chemotherapy agents have been introduced there are also newer types of rmachines and techniques however in regards to radiation if you had the same exact problem now versus 13 years ago the treatment might be exactly the same
2160,i'm i'm sorry you're having problems with your legs and feet unfortunately  without an examination and further testing (nerve conduction studies  repeat mri of your lower back  etc) it's simply not possible to determine why you're having these symptoms depending on the type of surgery you had  your numbness could be caused by transient inflammation and swelling around the surgical site such swelling could compress nearby nerve roots and cause numbness in your lower extremities alternatively  it's possible your legs or ankles were crossed or compressed during surgery or shortly thereafter  when you were too sedated to change positions this could cause a palsy in one or more of the peripheral nerves in your legs given time  this  too  should resolve finally  it's possible you experienced some as yet undetected damage during your surgery that injured the nerves in your back if that's the case  your numbness might be permanent you may need to consult a neurologist or neurosurgeon to get the answers to your questions i hope things go well for you!
2161,your your description of your symptoms of right sided pain that goes into the back  gas and belching  sounds very much like the symptoms many people describe from their gallstones the symptoms are usually made worse after eating  especially if fatty or fried foods once symptoms develop  often people note that the frequency of their ill feeling may increase  or happen more often there is probably little benefit to wait to get more illness or have episodes of vomiting an ultrasound is usually sufficient unless there are some unusual problems that you are having that would require a ct scan your doctor or surgeon can discuss with you the best tests for your specific conditions laparoscopic surgery for gallbladder removal is often an outpatient surgery that one can recover from fairly quickly  in 2 weeks or less
2162,bleeding bleeding behind the eye is a relatively rare problem possible causes could include a ruptured aneurysm or trauma of some sort if instead this is bleedin inside of the eye  in the back  a careful examination by an ophthalmologist woudl help i would suggest that you ask your doctor for the cause of this problem
2163,not not all fractures show up on a standard x-ray  especially if they're hairline fractures if you're starting to see bruising  you might have a little fracture it takes 14 days for bone callus to be visible on an x-ray (bone callus is this white  fuzzy looking stuff that surrounds fractures as one of the stages of fracture healing)  so you might want to have your ankle re-x-rayed after 2 weeks to see if there is bone callus if you still have problems  an mri would not only be able to show an occult fracture  but would also tell if you tore one or more ligaments
2164,as as dr wint notes  the dark color under the nail is like a bruise when the nailbed (the area under the hard nail) gets injured  blood gets trapped under the nail depending on the amount of bleeding  the area may be large and start to elevate the nail a very large area will cause the nail to fall off there can be a broken bone (fracture is the same thing) under the nail most of these do not need treatment and heal well  even if they look exploded (comminuted)  but should at least be x-rayed if the fracture is big enough to involve the joint or distorts the bone too much (displaced)  it may need further care  such as splinting or surgery a particularly painful blood collection  called a subungal hematoma  is relatively common after a crush injury such as this many people will drain them to relieve the pressure and pain by burning a small hole in the fingernail in the case of a broken bone  though  this increased the risk of infection  though the risk is still relatively small there is also discussion about how much bruising to accept before repairing the nailbed some people argue that if the bruise is more than half the nail  it should be removed and the nailbed repaired i disagree i think the nail is the best splint for the nailbed and is best left in place to help mold the healing tissue
2165,if if it is all the way in the back it might be what is called a pericoronitis an infection of the gum over a partially erupted wisdom tooth try to brush it to clean it out  and you will have to see your dentist to either resolve the infection  or remove the wisdome tooth
2166,sleep sleep apnea is the interruption of your normal sleep pattern by a failure to breath consistently your breath is arrested by the tissue of your throat falling back and blocking the breathing airway when you are are accumulating so much carbon dioxide in your blood stream that your body sensors tell you that you are close to being poisoned by it an emergency response waken you and you choke and splutter until the airway is open and you can get a gasp of air this process blows off some of the carbon dioxide and allows you to return to a fitful sleep you will notice it is not about the oxygen so necessary to keep your brain alive and you body functioning people who have apnea can suffer brain damage and even die from suffocation you dentist is goin to talk to you about a device worn in the mouth that will pull the lower jaw forwards so that the tissues of the throat are less like to block the airway while you sleep this can be a life saving device what can you expect? well a few days getting used to the appliance  may be some additional dental appointment for adjustments you can expect to sleep more restfully and not be so tired during the day which prevents you from thinking clearly you might actually live longer it is possible that you will have bad breath from mouth breathing  so get used to needing to be extra good about oral hygeine  brush floss and rinse! dr neil mcleod dds dentistry that lasts - quality that counts
2167,symptoms = surgery symptomatic gallstones are an indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy not an emergency but don't wait forever
2168,see your dentist see your dentist first if you are not feeling better  or confident in your current dental office  seek another opinion see an oral surgeon know that there are specialists for dentures -- prosthodontists
2169,yes the glands are lymph nodes which are part of your body's defense mechanism when fighting off infection  they may swell up and become tender the location of the sores you mention and the swelling of the glands leads me to suspect that you might be having an episode of herpes in conjunction with the aphthous ulcers you might want to see your dentist or family md for an evaluation feel better
2170,are are we sure this is a lymph node? an isolated lymph node in the suboccipital area would be unusual unless there were inflammatory/infectious processes of the posterior scalp skin or very rarely spread of skin cancers did it appear at the time of your other symptoms or has it possibly been present for some time and you now just noticed it sebaceous cysts (blocked oil glands) or small lipomas (fatty tumors-benign) can be mistaken for a lymph node if it persists beyond 3-4 weeks it would be reasonable to have it looked at if it remains swollen and tender (not usually a characteristic of a malignant lymph node) a course of appropriate antiobiotics and short term oral steroids wouldn't be inappropriate
2171,you can eat however  if left untreated  it can put you at greater risk of systemic problems such as blood infection  breathing problems and heart disease see a dentist for definitive treatment

2173,breast cancer i perform immediate breast reconstruction on patients every week who will get radiation treatments i prefer to perform the diep flap for patients who i know will get radiated because i can take care of your own tissue much easier than an implant after radiation the only time i don't perform or delay the reconstruction is when the tumor is close to the chest wall and maybe difficult to check

2178,hello hello i certainly hope that your bleeding has stopped it has been some time since your surgery do they plan to get another ct scan to see if blood has resorbed or if there is still bleeding? often surgeons work in treatment teams  where they can ask for input from colleages if your surgeon isn't sure how he or she plans to proceed  ask if obtaining a second opinion would be helpful

2191,no get something that works the best over-the-counter remedy is benzoyl peroxide  and it's not very good your physician may add topical clindamycin (my favorite and very cheap) or the more pricey retinoic acid derivatives (good if there's a lot of blackheads) if this isn't good enough  move to a systemic antibiotic  or a dermatologist has the big guns you need not have unwanted acne  good luck
2192,don't stop now! the purpose of all the treatment is to reduce your risk of recurrence you are fortunate to have a chance at cure if it recurs it is deadly the hardest part is behind you (chemotherapy) yet the most important treatment   that lowers your risk the most  is what's left talk to your doctors and counselors! good luck

2207,dose dependent the risk of cancer is related to the degree of radiation exposure the dose from diagnostic ct scans is not insignificant  but keep in mind that you would have to have several to increase your risk even slightly a recent study showed that ct scans in children can increase the risk of cancer (brain and leukemia)  but the overall effect is small  translating into one additional cancer among 10000

2218,amox not great amoxicillin is not a great drug for sinusitis amoxicillin + clavulante (augmentin) is preferred a short course of steroids (prednisone) may be helpful as well but if you have had symptoms this long  i would see your local ent there are some newer technologies to open your sinuses up in the clinic using balloon technology like angioplasty: acclarentcom

2224,also lyme disease if you have been bitten by a tick or live near the woods (or frequently go camping)  consider getting tested for lyme disease as well some of the symptoms  especially the (migratory?) rash are reminiscent of lyme disease
2225,false tests although urine preg tests are much more accurate than in past  they can still give false results if in doubt  a quantitative b-hcg test (blood) should be done this will measure not just positive or negative but toatl value to follow and confirm a healthy pregnancy will double value every 2-3 days if positive but staying same or going down  concern for miscarriage or tubal preg
2226,late period sounds like just a late period but check a pregnancy test to be sure
2227,lymph nodes the lymph nodes usually enlarge as response to an infection in the vicinity it lasts maximum 2-3 weeks and as the infection goes away (with antibiotics usually) the lymph nodes disappear outside this scenario  i would be worried and demand further investigation (ct is appropriate  a blood smear and cbc with differential  as well as a bmp with enzymes markers analysis) up to an excision biopy

2234,she won't i used to always ask surgeons to do a sentinel node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy for that very reason however  newer data show the lymph node status after chemotherapy may be more important newer data also show that women don't always need a full axillary dissection with a few positive nodes  so i'm ok with either approach if the lymph nodes aren't enlarged to start
2235,possible dry socket contact your dentist or oral surgeon who removed the teeth to determine if this could be normal discomfort or a dry socket a dry socket may occur if the initial blood clot was lost this can occur if you smoke or drink from a straw the strong negative pressure caused by the sucking on the cigarette or straw  can pull the clot loose

2350,fever sore throat would get a strep test because the complications of untreated strep can be significant  rheuamtic fever  rarely endocarditis so would go to urgent care and do strep test or better have them send out a culture  strep can cause tonsillitis   it is just a worse infection then just the sore throat coudl also be from post nasal drip  viral   mycoplasma  reflux but get a strep test

2395,pain plantar fasciitis can result in pain in a lot of places - not just the feet you could also have osteoarthritis in those other weight bearing joints see your podiatrist - orthotics help with plantar fasciitis about 95% of the time in my practice they just might help those other areas as well by getting 'things' aligned  good luck

2421,possible  plus  rarely the gb duct does not remain sealed after gb removed or the bile duct is nicked  either way resulting in a bile leak and persistent problems ultrasound? if this is the case  the sphincter of oddi could be an issue; stenting it open for several weeks often resolves such problems however  many other possibilities; post-op pain and/or other (nominally unrelated to gb/liver) issues going on

2441,numbness to know for sure  you need an examination differential diagnosis could be c8 cervical radiculopathy (pinched nerve in neck)  brachial plexopathy  peripheral nerve entrapment such as ulnar neuropathy  or even myofascial pain with trigger points would suggest a pm&r evaluation for definitive diagnosis and treatment

2862,recommended in patients with diabetes  the recommended level for ldl is below 100 if you are already doing a fairly good job of avoiding fats in your diet  then additional treatment  most commonly with a statin  would be recommended to bring your ldl down to the desired level
2863,mri guidelines mri of brain and spinal cord may show areas of abnormal signal which are consistent with ms but must be taken in the context of the individual's clinical course  objective findings on the neurological exam  and no better explanation forthcoming ms diagnosis can be supported by mri findings  often with additional support from spinal fluid abnormalities consistent with the diagnosis
2864,possibly repeat test occult testing often leads to false positives abnormal test results may occur after eating meat  a nosebleed or gum bleed it does not necessarily indicate internal bleeding with stage iiib lung cancer and severe copd  i suspect your doctor believes there is really no benefit to further testing due to these very severe illnesses that will probably limit lifespan
2865,maybe but you need to have this checked out to see what damage has actually occurred and what can be done to heal ankle orthotics and supportive shoes are also important refrain from weightbearing activity
2866,not necessarily  fish oil will not lower total cholesterol and may in fact increase ldl you need a statin or niacin  see your doctor
2867,yes in fact  lithium is probably the best/most studied medication for the treatment of bipolar disorder it is very effective in many but not all cases it has been shown to be the most effective treatment for suicidality it can be safe and effective  especially for bipolar i disorder or a manic episode
2868,can be quite similar vascular dementia causes deficits in the areas of the brain affected by stroke alzheimers disease causes problems with memory  language  making decisions  planning multistep tasks and gradual decline in functioning behavioral symptoms - hallucinations  delusions  depression  anxiety  agitation  aggression  irritability  disinhibition  apathy  can occur with both illnesses some folks have both
2869,yes in some cases hormonal treatment can be as effective as chemotherapy however if there is benefit from chemotherapy then it would be in addition to hormonal therapy you should ask what percent benefit chemotherapy would give your circumstance and then decide if it's worth it to you to not accept that benefit
2870,you need to contact your dr asap
2871,maybe however  bulging discs are usually normal findings  a further workup may be needed to rule out other sources such as a neuropathy ( which may have various causes like diabetes) or a higher level problem with your spine you should see a neurologist for a detailed workup
2872,consider uae for women with symptomatic fibroids and adenomyosis who dont respond to medical management  there are really only 2 choices: uterine artery embolization (uae) or hysterectomy i prefer uae as its non-surgical and if successful would allow a woman to keep her uterus the clinical success rate for uae with adenomyosis is not as high as it is for fibroids (70% vs 90%) but worth risk in my opinion
2873,rf - rheum arthritis you could have rheumatoid factor negative (rf-) rheumatoid arthritis not likely gout without crystals in fluid other possibilities are pseudo gout or lupus you may want to see a rheumatologist
2874,uric acid stones yes  this is possible: uric acid stones are not very radio-opaque - so plain xray miss them; so might ct  unless contrast is used ultrasound will not miss them  unless small - less than 5 mm
2875,most likely  not degenerative disc disease is a form of arthritis involving the articulations of the spine as the disease progresses  the articulations become more and more dysfunctional many times the disease is self limiting and can be managed medically sometimes the articulations have to be stabilized surgically
2876,rashes rashes are tough hard to tell w/o seeing it and a good history and physicalsee your primary care physicianpossible referral for dermatology or podiatry
2877,ultrasound results what you are describing are ultrasound results a hypoechoic nodule of 3 mm of size is nearly 100% benign the only reason to assess if a nodule is overactive (hot) or underactive (cold) is in general hyperthyroidism if the nodule is hot  then it can be the target of therapy this is done through a i-131 uptake and scan
2878,go to er don't mess around go to er if these symptoms exist a heart attack can cause tooth and jaw pain especially on the left side
2879,eczema? rubella? many conditions can cause generalized swollen lymph nodes rubella pops to mind immediately but any skin inflammation can lead to swollen regional nodes elbow lymph node enlargement used to be a sign of syphilis please have them checked by his pediatrician to find out the cause
2880,see your dr ongoing headaches like this are not normal see your neurologist for a formal workup this needs to be looked into
2881,should be evaluated although the majority of lumps and bumps that appear on arms and legs are benign the only way to be sure is to see a doctor and have it examined sometimes an mri is needed to make the diagnosis best not to ignore it especially if it is painful or sensitive
2882,possible better to be in the hospital get checked out it may not be heart related in a 22 year old  but can't be sure
2883,several things the most common is incomplete emptying of the bladder because of an enlarged prostate
2884,remember the moa as an aside  it's important to remember how these meds work your allergies are caused by histamine release in the body antihistamines block the release of histamine  not its effects its important therefore to take allergy medicine prior to experiencing the allergy symptoms antihistamines are to prevent allergy symptoms  not get rid of them once they've already shown up
2885,stress fractures can cause long term swelling repetitive trauma to an area that underwent a stress fracture will continue to have stress-induced swelling if you are not wearing an orthotic in your shoe that helps to displace pressure and impact trauma away from the fracture site  then you will continue to have stress-type symptoms in that area  including post-injury swelling
2886,unexplained infertil it sounds like you are describing unexplained infertility most obgyns are limited in treatment they can provide for fertility but clomid is something they can do to get more treatment or to rule out other problems you would need a fertility consultation with a specialist for unexplained infertility  clomid alone has not generally found to be as effective as clomid combined with insemination
2887,needs to be removed in general  of an infected scalp cyst has a persistent infection unresponsive to antibiotic therapy  the lining will need to be removed and the wound may need to be left open it generally takes a few weeks for the open wound to heal from the bottom up  and it needs to be packed with gauze which is changed 1-3 times per day
2888,nope you can have it drained  but ganglions come back more often after drainage than after surgical removal drainage involves the doctor sticking the ganglion with a needle and aspirating the thick fluid out with a syringe good luck
2889,a comon condition this is a frequently occurring condition it should have completely resolved since july an ultrasound will confirm that it is gone
2890,norma/concerning when our skin sustains an injury  immediate response is inflammation (red  hot  tender swelling) for about 48-72 hours this is the body increasing blood flow to the area to bring healing factors and is normal healing if it gets worse over time (increase in pain  fevers  chills  more redness)  then it may be infected or the lupus may be reacting if so  then seeing the doc may be your best bet
2891,yes jumping exercises aggravate the condition  but swimming is safe
2892,pretty high i would simply say that if you are infected  you will likely transmit it to your loved one if you don't take appropriate precautions unprotected activity will contaminate your partner
2893,bug bites?? if the spots don't increase  they might be just bug bites if they keep increasing  then they might be hives  an allergic reaction (of course there could also be multiple bugs causing new bites) otc creams or gels that contain 1% hydrocortisone or the skin anesthetic pramoxine can both be helpful (the dr can advise on what age range the meds can be used in) the dr may want to examine the rash
2894,not at all typically nondisplaced fractures of the toes can be treated with a post-op walking shoe or nothing at all depending on the amount of pain you are having
2895,unrx'd cancer grows while it is true that as many as 90% of all breast cancers are environmental in origin  it is difficult if not impossible to identify the specific cause of your cancer regardless  once diagnosed  breast cancer is eminently treatable left untreated  it will continue to grow please seek out medical care if you haven't already done so good luck
2896,contagious after rx usually  the a general guideline would be that a person is not contagious after 48 hours' worth of antibiotics with strep throat  a general guideline is 24 hours but this can vary depending on the disease
2897,no and yes not all cancers bleed  and elevated or low wbc count is not specific for colon cancer if undiagnosed  it will obstruct the flow of fecal material and or bleed  once it gets to a larger size
2898,glasses don't change wearing glasses refocuses the eyes do that the brains gets a clear image this helps prevent amblyopia (lazy eye) in children wearing glasses does not affect the growth of the eye and won't increase or decrease the changes in shape of the eye over time the biggest reason to wear glasses is to ensure normal vision development (prevent amblyopia)
2899,allergy reaction head ache   migraine is very common allergic reaction to caffeine  see your doctor  stop drinking coffee tea and cola which contain caffeine   before blaming aneurysm  and brain tumor
2900,not related the inr is not used to come off the warfarin inr is a measure of the blood clotting ability and is used to monitor the effect of the warfarin the goal is between 2 and 3 if less than 2  the warfarin effect is not enough to protect one and > 3 it causes excess bleeding risk the duration of therapy depends on circumstances surrounding the dvt and can range from 3 months to lifetime treatment
2901,several months after starting warfarin the blood clot can no longer grow the body will start to break down the clot within days it takes months to have the clot reabsorbed or for the process to make an opening through the clot so blood can get through again swelling will be visibly less in a few weeks but it could be 6 months before the leg is back to normal occasionally  the swelling persists indefinitely
2902,maybe might have existed before the surgery could be related to poor production  decreased outflow (lacrimal drain issues)  reflexive with poor tear film or lid position making incisions on the cornea sometimes affects the feedback loop of the cornea and tears
2903,not aware of diet i am not aware of diet to reduce the size of fibroids
2904,surgeon follow up even with the great advances in medicine  there is still no such thing as a risk free surgery every surgery runs the risk of developing complications pain and burning may be normal in the immediate post operative period close follow up with his surgeon is encouraged to ensure these symptoms are normal and not the result of unwanted complications
2905,need oncotype-dx while your prognosis is excellent  we know that some women with your stage may benefit from traditional chemotherapy in addition to an aromatase inhibitor nowadays  we are moving towards molecular staging over anatomic staging; oncotype-dx is a multi-gene assay that can provide information regarding your probability of recurrence; if it is high  traditional chemo will be recommended
2906,very rare  but well-recognized complication of breast radiation therapy (of course  when you are that one in a million  that doesn't help) modern techniques are designed to maximize rx to the breast & minimize effects on the heart and lungs your radiation oncologist certainly should have discussed this with you pre-treatment--informed consent is a necessary part of any rx regimen
2907,possibly more important is the pathology we rely on pathology and the immunochemistry the pet may be helpful but sometimes we do not find a primary this is called a cancer of unknown primary
2908,bump with pain there are several possibilities  including a stye and an abscess if t is tender  it may be infected an abscess needs to be drained by a skilled eye surgeon (ophthalmologist) do not try to drain it yourself  since it may be located near a tear drainage duct
2909,sinus surgery balloon sinuplasty - minimally invasive technique  uses a small balloon inflated to widen blocked passages  generally has less bleeding and shorter recovery time endoscopic sinus surgery - uses a small camera to visually examined the sinuses tiny surgical instruments inserted to remove obstructive tissues  does not require any incision as the whole procedure is performed through the nostrils
2910,yes you can get pregnant however  you are at increased risk for another ectopic prgnancy or fertility issues associated to tubal disease
2911,could be sleep apnea but you need to see a doctor the internet is a great place to answer some questions like what is sleep apnea? or what is cheyne-stokes breathing? the internet not a good place to get a diagnosis that requires obtaining a complete history  a hands-on physical exam  maybe a sleep study or echocardiogram  etc  use the internet to get the questions to bring to your doctor  not the answers
2912,good numbers look good  continue healthy diet and excercise to keep them at ideal level
2913,probably not you need to see a doctor anytime you have numbness of any part of your body wisdom teeth usually cause pain and tightness-not numbness please seek medical attention
2914,no but your symptoms may be secondary to a vasculitis  dermatitis  diabetes  etc you need to see your pcp and undergo a complete medical evaluation
2915,one of the risks nerve damage is one of the risks of wisdom tooth extraction please see this site for more information http://wwwmayocliniccom/health/wisdom-tooth-extraction/my01212
2916,no a pap test looks for cervical cancer if you had a full hysterectomy  it means you don't have a cervix and therefore can't get cervical cancer and you don't need a pap test you will however need a pelvic exam  becuase that checks our pelvis and ovaries  which you will still have after a hysterectomy
2917,dissection? i would recommend seeing your doctor soon not enough info or exam to tell  but could be a vertebral dissection or narrowing of a blood vessel in back of head special imaging is needed to look for this  and complications can be devastating if gone undiagnosed  
2918,infection v allergy if this is acute  then most likely it's a viral infection if you have a history of allergy  then it could be cause if antihistamines don't help  it's probably a virus your doctor can tell you with more certainty with a physical exam
2919,see below your hdl is fine i would concentrate on lowering ldl to less than 120 diet  exercise  no smoking are the best would avoid statins at this point given your young age omega 3 won't hurt but probably not helpful as it will not lower ldl
2920,generally yes your case could be affected by several variables and you will need to review these with your surgeon make sure you are at a center where they are doing a lot of these and that your surgeon is very good ask them for specific numbers of cases just like yours
2921,need to see a doctor you need at least an x-ray to rule out any fracture and then determine what treatment is needed
2922,could be a few days this is a possible complication but usually the sensation of the lip and chin returns completely it can be as soon as a few days or as long as many weeks discuss these issues with your doctor at the 1 week follow up appointment most patients do fine
2923,also consider i agree with the other answers and suggest spry nasal spray which has been helpful to some of my patients
2924,you should visit a doctor and have it checked out at minimum  you likely should be wearing an ankle brace if you injure the ankle and it is unstable and you continue to walk on it you are not allowing it to heal properly
2925,splint not cast most physicians would likely apply a splint rather than a cast for a suspected fracture repeat xrays would likely be obtained a week later to confirm or exclude the possibility of fracture
2926,postop infection amoxicillin would be the first choice  unless you're allergic to penicillin other choices include clindamycin or keflex more importantly  have you contacted your oral surgeon or been back to see them? you should  if you haven't a postoperative wound infection can potentially be serious  and could lead to an abscess requiring an incision and drainage procedure  or even osteomyelitis see the doc
2927,myopic astigmatism your options include glasses  contact lenses  surface laser eye surgery  phakic intaocular lens implant  intracorneal ring segments  or orthokeratology the magnitude of your prescription would determine which options can be considered
2928,yes ganglion cysts on the top side (non-palm side) of the hand can be removed through an aspiration procedure this is a simple office procedure where a needle is introduced into the ganglion cyst and its contents are aspirated however  the risk of recurrence following an aspiration procedure is very high--as high as 75-80% consider the risks of recurrence when deciding on treatment options
2929,typically not a hole in the retina comes from traction from the vitreous (jelly) on the retina in the back portion of the eye during surgery  or the healing process from cataract surgery this traction may increase this can result in formation or progression of a hole in the retina typically one has a pre-disposing condition  complication  or traction for this to happen associated with cataract surgery
2930,huh? if you are not diabetic why are you measuring bg three times around your meal? you are asking for trouble stick with the standard method of diagnosis you are not at risk for organ damage until you become diabetic range and should not do anything other than eat a good mediterranean diet  maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly
2931,can try homeopathy pelvic pain and increased urinary frequency are classic bulk symptoms from fibroids there are some homeopathic medicines that can help but in my experience often the symptoms progress until something more definitive is needed depending the age  number of fibroids  desire for future fertility  she may need either myomectomy (surgical removal of the fibroids) or uterine artery embolization (uae)
2932,sometimes due to location of the nerve in the jaw this is sometimes a side effect of removing wisdom teeth their may or may not have been any way to avoid it
2933,probably not its not how long your period lasts but how long your cycles are that determines when you ovulate the average cycle (from the first day of menses to the next first day of menses) is 28 days ovulation occurs on the fourteenth day of the cycle so intercourse on the 7th day is not around ovulation if your cycle is 21 days  however  then ovulation occurs on day 7 and pregnancy is possible
2934,chest lesion bloody  pustular lesions on the chest wall in the midline rarely indicate breast cancer  notwithstanding your age and risk history  which you did not share you might have a msra abscess  which can linger for weeks  but if it persists  a visit to your dermatologist would be warranted
2935,may benefit a cast or a rigid walking boot may be used in such a situation
2936,yes very safe most women who have fibroids do not have symptoms (exs most commonly heavy menstrualbleeding  pelvic pain  increased urinary frequency) and therefore nothing is done about them we call these fibroids passangers as they ride along in the uterus until menopause and then start to die off no worries
2937,what to do? i agree with all of the other answers with a superficial clot  the value of compression is to decrease pain by decreasing inflammation you can also reduce inflammation with anti-inflammatory medicines  warm soaks  ice packs and leg elevation it is worth it to talk to your doctor about a lighter compression stocking too i would not recommend  however  an ace bandage they can make it worse
2938,mri knee sounds like you need to discuss it with your orthopedic surgeon it may or may not be a significant new tear there may be other issues of arthritis  etc that may be causing your pain
2939,that's a possibility it is possible that you have a clot i would get that checked out as the consequences of a clot can be serious
2940,possible not all kidney stones show up on x-ray if the pain is only at night it is not likely to be a stone you should see your doctor for a proper work-up
2941,possible hopefully  the area of numbness has been getting smaller over these 7 months if it has  that is favorable sometimes nerve damage occurs during lower wisdom tooth extraction and it can take quite a few months to resolve sometimes it doesn't but keep your fingers crossed as it often does
2942,no fixing the hernia is the primary problem and comes with its own set of risks one of the more common complications of hernia surgery is wound infection (albeit very rare) attempting to remove fat at the same operation would dramatically increase you risk of wound complications take care of you primary problem and  after your recovery  focus your attention on weight reduction
2943,dryness lasik can aggravate dry eye conditions dry eyes should be treated regardless if having lasik or not
2944,depends depending on how it is treated you can expect at least immobilazation or possible surgery
2945,depends it would be great if the answer was a definitive yes and  though the way you describe it  it seems likely  but it depends on the type of cancer  the extent of involvement  and the size of metastases also  if there are obscuring findings  like a diffuse pneumonia  it might be difficult to pick up on x-ray
2946,yes  yes  an enlarged ovary could be mistaken for a mass in the pelvis an ovarian cyst could be described as a low density structure which could be near the sigmoid colon  but without seeing the images it is impossible to know whether this is the case the best way to evaluate the ovaries is with transpelvic and/or transvaginal ultrasound it may be helpful to have your doctor discuss the findings with the radiologist the radiologist should be able to give some recommendations as to whether further evaluation with imaging such as pelvic ultrasound would be helpful or whether you should be referred directly to a surgical specialist
2947,similiar interstitial lung disease is an umbrella term for many diseases; one of these disease is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or ipf
2948,as as we age  the lens inside our eye undergoes change it becomes more cloudy and stiff the clouding of the lens is called a cataract  and most of us will need a cataract surgery when the lens becomes very cloudy affecting our daily activities this typically occurs in our 70's certain medical conditions and medications can make the progression of cataract faster now the stiffening of the lens occurs at early 40's and this process is called a presbyopia (a greek term for old vision) as the lens becomes more stiff  its ability to accomodate is lost this leads to difficulty focusing for objects that are close your distance vision should not be afftected most people use reading glasses for their presbyopia contact lenses for correcting presbyopia is not recommended since this will lead to blurry distance vision again  this need for reading glasses with presbyopia should have been explained by the surgeon prior to the lasik surgery
2949,astigmatism ; lasik lasik is a procedure that can definitely help patients with astigmatism  as long as the corneal topography shows a normal appearing cornea so - can see your own doctor and get evaluated to see if you are eligible for lasik
2950,chemoembolization chemoembolization is one of the many weapons we have to fight liver tumors advanced cirrhosis  hep c  and blood clotting problems are not in themselves contraindications for this procedure (although certain lab values such as bilirubin and inr/ platelets must be within a suitable range) you should discuss with an interventional oncologist to see whether it would be suitable for you
2951,treat cause the best way to make your dry eyes better is to find out the cause of your dry eye disease environmental exposure  decrease mucin   aqueous  lipid  pharmacologic  hormonal etc get an exam to determine the cause so you can get a customized treatment plan
2952,lasik i agree that lasik would be best
2953,very different some babies are born with cow's milk protein allergy which they may grow out of it can lead to blood in the stool  fussiness (gerd) or rash some with cows mp allergy also have soy allergy which means no milk intake for mom when nursing or a special formula for baby lactose intolerance happens later and is due to poor gut absorption of milk it can lead to gassiness and loose stool
2954,yes this would be very unusual but not impossible  and would raise the suspicion of an unusual type of cancer at that age
2955,nope don't worry stds are caused by germs passed from one person to another having sex doesn't create stds if neither partner has an std before sex occurs  neither one can get an std of course if either person has had sex with someone else  he or she might bring an std into the relationship that can happen without knowing the std was there this is the only way stds sometimes appear in monogamous couples
2956,short answer no losing your uterus at such a young age will likely have negative consequences which are completely avoidable by undergoing uterine fibroid embolization (ufe) instead your uterus is important to you psychologically  sexually  and there is increased osteoporosis and heart disease risks with hysterectomy i'd find an interventiomal radiologist with particular experience in ufe and keep your parts!
2957,perhaps corneal abrasion at the time of cataract surgery can happen  but it is very rare certain conditions can increase the incidence (dry eyes  blepharitis  even previous lasik) the retinal swelling also is somewhat rare to the level you are describing  but it too still happens conditions like diabetes  uveitis history  and pre-existing wrinkling of the retina (epiretinal membrane) increase risk
2958,bone chip because you state you have a bone chip i will assume you have had x rays taken if the chip is in a position to hurt you speak to your podiatrist who will guide you in making the decision that is right for you good luck !
2959,both do both lasik and prk will treat myopia and astigmatism
2960,yes new intraocular lens designs can correct both astigmatism and nearsightedness  allowing for the possibility of excellent uncorrected distance vision your ophthalmologist can determine if you are a candidate for this type of premium lens implant
2961,osa yes  it can create irritability  depression like symptoms  poor concentration  poor memory and many others
2962,see a doctor go to a local medical clinic and have the doctor evaluate the nodes  better safe than sorry
2963,viral illness lymph node enlargement differential diagnosis (ddx) is large  but likely an acute viral illness -- eg influenza if not improved soon see a doctor for ddx see table 3 especially - lad a-z http://wwwmathenyinfo/files/habermann_mayo_clin_proc_2000_75_723pdf
2964,classic classic carpal tunnel syndrome see if a wrist splint helps you sleep at night if you still get numb with the splint on or if you are a little numb all the time  it's time to see a hand surgeon carpal tunnel syndrome can be cured with surgery if we get to it prior to advanced nerve damage
2965,unless unless you are experienced reading ultrasounds  wait for the radiologist to review and interpret it for you
2966,testing can prove if you have symptoms due to peripheral neuropathy  an emg-nerve conduction test should be abnormal unless it is a small fiber neuropathy  which can be confirmed under the microscope if you have ms  mri of head and/or spinal cord could confirm diagnosis  but spinal fluid studies often can doubly confirm suspicions blood and urine studies can rule out other diseases which mimic ms
2967,don't delay in getting evaluatedconsider er
2968,get it looked at the ingrown part of the nail is not always visible try soaking your foot in warm water  removal of embedded debris from the nail borders  and applying an antibiotic ointment to temporarily soften the corners if you have redness and drainage  get it looked at by a professional  as you may need to have the ingrown nail border removed you may need antibiotics
2969,chicken pox water filled bumps sound like chicken pox until proven otherwise
2970,drip may not be the sinuses could be a sign of silent acid reflux also called lpr one of its symptoms is a drip and nausea see an ent to look at the larynx or voice box to see of there are signs it it you may need to see a gi
2971,yes most breast cancers are first treated with surgery after breast-conserving surgery  radiation is necessary not all breast cancers need treatment with chemotherapy if a breast cancer is estrogen sensitive  it can often be treated with an oral medication that blocks estrogen instead of chemotherapy
2972,muscle spasm trigger points are bands of taut muscle areas that hurt when pressed upon and radiate to other areas than just the painful spot that is pressed upon most times stretching and massage of that area relieves these spots  however sometime they continue and need to be addressed by your doctor if this doesn't resolve it or touch doesn't hurt  consider this being sciatica and get spine evaluation
2973,yes if the disease is limited and original colon cancer addressed focal intense radiation called radiosurgery can be very effective if there is significant disease then standard radiation can be used to help symptoms
2974,no! no! remember doctors can not diagnose over the phone or internet  but is the 'stye' you describe a painful bump in your eyelid? --if so the treatment is not a steroid (so no hydrocortisone) a stye is a 'blocked gland' in your eyelid (it's a mechanical problem) the general treatment is: -warm compressess -anti-biotic eye drop or ointment and if not improved : a small surgical procedure by an ophthomologist hope you're better soon
2975,thin chest wall if he has a thin chest well he may be feeling his heart hitting up against his chest wall like a ping pong ball nothing serious
2976,absolutely lymph nodes should be checked by a doctor and not on the internet
2977,not unless sensitive best management of a uti is for dr to get urine sample for culture & sensitivities before antiantibiotics are taken patient can start antibiotics as soon as sample is taken result will be ready in 48 hrs and show which antibiotics will be effective against bacteria causing your uti if bacteria are resistant  as yours are  an appropriate antibiotic can be selected  usually not amoxil
2978,no the risk to the transplanted lungs are infection from bacteria left over from the old lungs  and acute and chronic rejection of the new lung by the body cystic fibrosis is a defect that is limited to the old lungs
2979,i i think it's time for a second opinion you're incredibly young to have all this going on in your foot & ankle  and i would also get an mri to see exactly where the tears and damage is i would strongly discourage you from any exploratory surgery in an effort to fix what's wrong i would get an accurate diagnosis first i'm also concerned about those cortisone injections you were getting for a stress fracture i've never heard of giving cortisone for a stress fracture in fact  quite the contrary  steroids tend to delay healing of fractures  and they come with the risk of tendon rupture  which you apparently had please get a second opinion before proceeding any further preferably with either a foot & ankle orthopedist or a podiatrist certified in foot & ankle surgery by the american board of podiatric surgery good luck!
2980,varies there are a number of potential causes  but among the most common is plantar fasciitis  which can usually be diagnosed by an examination and will usually respond to stretching  an orthotic  or sometimes a cortisone shot  don't hesitate to be seen
2981,blepharospasm u having had lasik does not preclude you from having blepharoplasty the dryness could be an issue have your eyes evaluated by a board certified surgeon with expertise in eyelid surgery
2982,an infection use antibiotic ointment and a yeast prep--if not better see a drthis is unlikely to be an std
2983,if if you are over the age of 12  your vision from the lazy eye will not improve that is why it is important for a child to have a early vision screening and if a treatment is needed that it is followed through now  if you are talking about being crossed eye then there is a surgery to correct this
2984,? molluscum there are many possibilities  but one that fits your description might be molluscum contagiosum this is a viral infection of the skin you should see a health professional for further evaluation
2985,cystoscopy the next reasonable step in your care is cystoscopy under anesthesia you will need biopsies and/or transurethral resection of the mass discovered
2986,many possibilities your pain could be as a result of many different things causes of pain may include: trauma (fracture  sprain  arthritis)  infection (ingrown nail)  metabolic conditions (gout)  musculoskeletal or biomechanical abnormality and neurologic conditions (neuropathy) a thorough history and physical exam and possibly some laboratory and radiology exams are needed to determine the exact cause
2987,certain certain local anesthetics can have a duration of action of 6 to 8 hours depending on the site of injection these long acting anesthetics are routinely used in third molar surgery to provide extended relief from surgical pain if the anesthesia remains the morning after the surgery it may indicate that the nerve in the area may have been disturbed this is a known consequence associated with the removal of the lower third molars and can result from stretching  compressing or tearing of the nerve stretching and compression injuries have better prognosis for recovery  though it may take several months for full sensation to return thought injuries typically do not require further treatment  just monitoring injuries that involve transection of the nerve can be permanent it is these types of injuries that may require further surgical treatment no matter the cause  prolonged anesthesia  greater than a day  require follow-up by the treating surgeon
2988,treating treating lazy eye or amblyopia requires a lot of motivation on both the part of the parents and child early intervention makes improvement possible - improvement in vision is the goal and if it does not occur by age 9  it likely will not improve when i see older individuals with a history of lazy eye that has improved  i remind them how lucky they are that it did improve and how lucky they were to have to have motivated parents and eye doctors

3536,it could be this could be allergic or viral but also could be non-allergic rhinitis would treat with antihistamine or decongestant and if no response discuss with your physician
3537,not so fast i would not go on an exhaustive  expensive shot gun approach to the many many different causes of chest pain more history can help differentiate most of them if it has been awhile it is not likely a life threatening issue like pe  dissection  heart attack  etc doing unnecessary testing gives people more stress and anxiety sometimes  not saying ignore  but be prudent given age reassuring
3538,infection vs allergy if the skin is infected  you may need a course of oral antibiotics if the reaction is more of an allergy  then topical or oral steroids could be the solution see your doctor for treatment
3539,can be similiar there is no way to know if you have yeast  bv  trichomonas ( which is sexually transmitted)  gc  or chlamydia based only on what a discharge looks and smells like if you have a discharge that is unusual for you  you need to be tested and treated
3540,probably detergent allergic reactions in the genital area are common as long as the foreskin and tip of penis are not red  low potency otc steroid cream will soothe things use a different hypo-allergenic suds
3541,could be it would take another look in getting the wax out it is easy to traumatize the ear canal which can cause some of your symptoms so another look and some ear drops probably

3547,spine mri? facets are the joints between the vertebra in the spine facet changes refer to degenerative bone process that can be a normal part of the aging process after a certain age we all have them  me included
3548,sounds like you need to be seen you could have a bad strep throat that requires antibiotics or even develop an abscess in the back of your throat what's also really concerning is your reported stiff neck as an infection of the head and neck can spread towards the brain(very rare) but a stiff neck isn't quite typical you'd be best served by an inperson evaluation and sooner rather than later
3549,old uterine blood the fluid on the ct scan is probably old blood from the 25 days of bleeding it might be a good idea to see a gyn md and find out why
3550,chicken pox if it is chicken pox then it might help to see your doctor most children get vaccinated in this country  however they can still get a minor infection usually rash is less than the full blown response you treat chicken pox with acyclovir  but this depends on how bad the rash is might be worth having rash seen and then determine if it is chickenpox or not
3551,appropriate question blood in or on the stool  or black tarry stool are always of concern however  in a young person with a streak of blood on the surface of the stool  the most common causes are a fissure or hemorrhoid  both of which can cause pain as well cancer is less common in young people other causes are also less common it's best to see your doctor for a careful exam to determine the cause in your case
3552,not als not als at your age it could be a muscle pull  tendon issue or even benign fasiculations your physician will help clarify that
3553,you need to see a doctor personally  make an appointment today
3554,allergic asthma what you need to do is get off the internet and go to the er you are having allergic bronchospasm which benadryl or zyrtec is not going to help this is an emergency
3555,depends on size many patients who undergo a ct scan of the chest will have small or medium size nodules that are non-specific a radiologist will document the size  and depending on the patients age and risk factors for developing lung cancer will recommend appropriate followup studies or sometimes even recommend a biopsy we can suspect  but not diagnose lung cancer without a tissue diagnosis
3556,yes but the real question is why bilateral foraminal stenosis at l4_l5 at your age is there disc disease  spondlolisthesis  history of trauma  and abnormality of nerve tests of the sciatic nerve  etc wise to see an orthopedic surgeon to evaluate
3557,yes you may see your doctor if it does not work
3558,time for eval now if the sprain is severe  there may be a rare outside chance that there is persistent joint instability with internal derangement somehow causing pressure on vasculature affecting *arterial* perfusion  not venous drainage like dvt time to go to er check for pulse strength; should be equal to other foot dorsal pedalis felt on top of foot; posterior tibialis behind medial malleolus keep leg warm
3559,no basal cell carcinomas can be treated effectively with local excision however  if you have had two basal cell carcinomas  you should do careful skin exam  perhaps as frequently as monthly  to look for suspicious lesions so that those may be removed early
3560,fna or core biopsy core biopsy (14g or larger) of the breast is more common than fna (18g or smaller) the former retrieves tissue samples that provide some architectural and other information today  a needle biopsy should almost always be done prior to surgery one should have a diagnosis before surgery not be making one in surgery that way  necessary info is obtained 1st and proper surgery planned
3561,risk it is all about risk the risk of undergoing the mammogram is far less than the risk of having breast cancer you are at an even higher risk of death getting in your car and driving on the freeway
3562,alcohol bad alcohol will increase your risk of breast cancer smoking will bad  doesn't seem to dramatically increase the risk of breast cancer
3563,further comments your nerve pain can be controlled  but you would do well to try these approaches: lyrica  if tolerated  can work at high dosing  >400 mg daily in thrice daily regimen cymbalta  and savella might work  but using gralise or horizant may make tolerance of gabapentin better the opioid nucynta is approved for neuropathy in diabetes local compounded pain cremes with ketamine  might work
3564,time for third test! you should consider yourself pregnant unless proven otherwise do urine pregnancy test at home and go to your doctor for a blood test for confirmation good luck:)
3565,both start with mammo see radiologyinfoorg
3566,if no improvement &amp; you have pain  fever  swelling  possible cellulitis developing  by all means go in now you don't have to wait a week and be in misery the dentist will understand  and evaluate what is happening to you to increase so much pain  and can double check that an abscess is not brewing you don't want to have cellulitis developing as it can go into your sinuses or eyes next get help fast!
3567,not recommended lyrica and neurontin are anticonvulsant medications and have a very similar chemical structure moreover  there is no utility to use them together some clinicians very rarely combine them for fibromyalgia however  there is no literature to support that
3568,at this point if you are 3 days late and are sexually active  consider checking a home pregnancy test signs that you might have a yeast infection include: vaginal itching  pain  thick white cheesy vaginal discharge and sometimes burning with urination if you are having some or all of these symptoms  you should seek an evaluation  especially if you've never had a yeast infection previously
3569,disc seems like the cartilaginous disc in your temporomandibular joint may be displaced please call your dentist the reason for the displacement has to be determined  and the disc needs to be recaptured

3571,itchy perianal bumps thank you for your question red itchy bumps around the anal area with pimples in a child may be caused by many things there are forms of inflammatory conditions of the skin that could cause a rash as well as responses to external/internal sources such as allergies or otherwise having an examination performed by a qualified medical practitioner would be helpful in diagnosis and treatment
3572,mgt of sx if the symptoms are related to a virus  and if the congestion is associated with fever  or has lasted three weeks or longer  your physician can evaluate your son for a sinus infection i agree that cool mist  nasal saline and nasal steroids help to alleviate inflammation of the nasal passages if you son is allergic to dust  keeping the bedroom as free from dust  mattress/pillow covers
3573,see an endodontist oral infections such as certain chronic abscess or cracked  fractured teeth can often be difficult to diagnose and treat in addition to dental school  endodontists receive 2-3 more years of advanced education in this kind of diagnosis and treatment that’s why you should see an endodontist for proper diagnosis and treatment
3574,yes rest  ice and elevation see how it feels tomorrow elbows can be particularly painful because of the funny bone actually a nerve that runs close to the surface (ulnar nerve) also be sure to take some ibuprofen or naproxen as well
3575,tylenol and coffee acetaminophen is safe in pregnancy (tylenol) small amounts of coffee are safe in pregnancy for most people perhaps your ob told you not to drink any  in which case you should do what they say however  i suggest you have a cup and gradually wean yourself off on the other hand  if you've already made it through today  maybe you should just go to bed tomorrow you'll be closer to off caffeine
3576,yes i wouldn't call it normal it is  however  practically universal
3577,it could be you should review your symptoms with your primary care doctor so that an adequate treatment plan can be set up for you best of luck
3578,workup and mgt there are many pids and some are associated with autoimmune disease since there is so much variation  the diagnosis can be difficult if you are prone to infections  the pattern of the infections  type and location will help your physician determine the diagnosis and treatment if you have lung involvement  an hrct is helpful most pids involve b cells and i would advise b cell studies
3579,abcd the abcd's can tell if you have a lesion concerning for melanoma: a-asymmetry b-irregular border  c-different colors within the mole  d-diameter >6mm if you have any concerns  see your dermatologist
3580,are you sure they didn't say hpv? a majority of genital warts are caused by human papilloma virus there is no correlation between warts and hiv other than some people have both just as some people have herpes and hiv relax they made a mistake or you heard wrong!
3581,elevated lfts hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver and reflects many different diseases elevated liver function tests  sgpt/sgot means you have hepatitis but it may not be infectious like hepatitis b/c but may be from other causes like autoimmune disease  gallbladder medications mets  or fatty liver in hepatitis the enzyme levels vary please follow up with gastroenterology this week  check sonogram 
3582,good exam i think you first should get a thorough exam of your shoulder  back and cervical spine areas you may have an injury to the shoulder but some of your symptoms may be of a cervical etiology i think there is an overreliance on mris often the mri may show abnormalities which are not even causing symptoms
3583,sinus infection? sinus allergy and asthma people suffering from sinus allergy and and asthma do occasionally develop bloody nasal discharge this could result from excessive dryness caused by the antihistamines and decongestants a chance of bacterial or viral infection cannot be ruled out if the symptoms continue or if you develop fever  a visit with your doctor may be warranted powlin manuel md  mba  ms
3584,not migraine  stroke a lesion affecting the supraorbital nerve would cause numbness of forehead and temple unilaterally—but you say you have numb temples [plural] it would not explain neck stiffness this does not sound like migraine variant to me migraine is intermittent and self-limited after a few hours nor does this sound at all like aneurysm or stroke i recommend you see a neurologist
3585,yes cleaning can involve going below the gum line to remove plaque and food this can irritate the gums and cause bleeding perhaps you can see the dentist or call them as soon as possible consider gargling with warm salt water and taking over the counter pain medicines
3586,likely basis either things you are eating or malabsorption with bile in stool & rapid transit if you are not digesting fats well; fats in the colon feed colonic bacteria resulting in gas & floating fecal material forget the multivitamin http://googl/htgfhm  antacid likely irrerelvant  codfish (like other oils) ? not being digested/absorbed both experiment & find someone worthy of you trust to help sort out issues
3587,microflora oka lot of questions here yes  florastor is my personal favorite probiotic i do not believe there is a proper study looking at ibs and florastor yet it is totally safe for those in remission for cdiff i see dozens of cases a year in my office the only way i could imagine extra gas is the proliferation of the microbesbut it will not be immediately upon taking the pill
3588,eyes sounds like you need to get an eye exam to see if you have a need for glasses
3589,here are some  glad you've taken all possible precaution to avoid std including hpv shots  but there is still no guaranty and healthy lifestyle without obsession / overindulgence is the surest means to optimize personal defense immune ability so to win the first-line invisible war of life for survival   besides  practicing safe sex is the plus for more enjoyable sex life what you described is probably ok
3590,how about referral if your doctor is unable to find the right medication or intervention to adequately treat your pain you may ask for a referral to either a rheumatologist (who are the recognized experts when it comes to diagnosing and managing fibromyalgia) or pain medicine specialist
3591,infection from your description  it is highly likely that you have developed a bacterial sinusitis and may need antibiotics and decongestants please schedule a doctor's visit as soon as possible
3592,mrsa infection the chances of transferring mrsa to your boyfriend are decreased if you have been on the appropriate antibiotic for at least 24 hours if there is still discharge from the wound then it may still be possible to transfer the infection you should take caution and keep the infected area well covered until the area is dry without discharge you should continue the medication as directed
3593,allergies or more? the above medications are typically used to treat allergies however  if the medications are not working  it is possible that you may have developed a secondary infection  such as sinusitis  ear infection  etc i would recommend that you follow up with your physician to discuss the persistence of your symptoms and/or development of new symptoms an antibiotic may be indicated at this time
3594,ear piercing it sounds like you were initially reacting to the metals in the pierced area causing chronic inflammation (nickel is especially problematic for many people) now it sounds infected (probably staph or strep) cease wearing any earrings put hot soaks on it for 20 minutes 3 times a days you probably need a round of antibiotics(topicals by themselves are seldom helpful) see a doc
3595,needs evaluation sounds like ringworm but that should not be causing the other symptoms needs to see primary care provider thanks for trusting healthtap!
3596,stretch first if you exercise without proper stretching you will experienced a spasm in some muscle while running the intercoastal muscle  the one sit betwwen your ribs becomes spastic and can cause sharp pain most likely it is not your heart if it keep happening you need to see a doctor for proper evaluation
3597,yes most other obvious problems would also be seen in the chest at that time
3598,within the week you can be tested for these within the week after intercourse i must advise the use of condoms in the future as hiv is easily spread by receptive anal intercourse as is hpv which is a cause of anal cancer
3599,dentist see your dentist asap damaged teeth can let bacteria leak into your bloodstream and cause health issues enlarged lymph nodes may be a sign that there might be an infection take care of this quickly
3600,stop guessing use speculum not speculation go to a gyn doctor for a checkup they will do a pelvic pap std checkup blood tests the doctor will visualize the area they may order a transvaginal ultrasound or additional tests to find out why you are having these symptoms
3601,hard to say she needs to see the pediatrician to get this evaluated it could be a skin infection or maybe a hernia
3602,masseter hypertrophy masseteric hypertrophy is a relatively uncommon  condition non-surgical modalities of treatment include tranquilizers or muscle relaxants  cognitive behavioral therapy and injection of very small doses of botox a see an orofacial pain specialist for consultation they are the expert in this field take care
3603,palpitation treat treatments include not using caffeine  alcohol   street drugs  smoking and other stimulant substances try to learn meditation and other calming techniques  cut out herbal substances  cough and cold medicines  nutritional supplements  see your doctor to be sure no direct heart problem and for treatment if the basics above don't help  your anxiety may be overdriving everything may see psych help
3604,best treatment for an abcess is draining it  sometimes nit biopics can't get to the walled off region if they are not working  it is possible the bacteria is resistant to the antibiotic you are on  or it simply isn't sensitive to it you need to let your dentist know of the situation by day 15 improvement should of been seen
3605,not enough info the cbc numbers are normal regarding the lymph node  there is concern if there are symptoms like weight loss  fever  night sweats if the node is very hard  or if greater than 1 cm in size  and has persisted for more than a month and is clearly not related to an infection biopsy is a possibility absent those findings  lymph nodes are usually just observed low pcv  mcv &mcv--? iron deficient
3606,fraxel for acne scar the fraxel laser is very effective for treating acne scars if used aggressively it requires several treatments but you can go to work without any downtime for faster results in one treatment with downtime use the pixel or fractionated co2 laser or the erbium lasers
3607,see your surgeon for evaluation  x-rays and treatment options
3608,most medications are  ok for blood donors there are some important exceptions see the red cross web page or ask your blood bank http://wwwredcrossbloodorg/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-topic
3609,salivary nodes these bumps may be swollen salivary glands that can get blocked by calcium deposits and then become infected easily treated with augmentin  but if infection returns i would seek attention from an ent to see if the salivary duct is blocked if this a lymph node infection  a biopsy is might be needed to determine the source of infection
3610,get medical check up pain in the breast is not a major symptom of breast cancer sp i would advise you to get a medical examination through your physician who can examine your breast and find the cause of your pain a mammogram of the breast can easily rule out any evidence of breast cancer so why delay and keep worrying about it?
3611,very unlikely tender nodes that are not obviously abnormal and aren't growing rapidly or matted to the surrounding tissue are almost never cancer  especially at your age i'd watch them if your current acne medicine isn't strong enough to manage it  this itself may be the cause best wishes
3612,see below a peripheral blood smear shows white blood cells(leukocytes)  lymphocytes  red blood cells and platelets  bacterial diseases will often cause an elevated number of leukocytes and viral diseases often cause an elevation of lymphocytes but there are many conditions other than infectious that can cause an increase in these cells and infection can be present even if the peripheral smear is normal
3613,mammo and u/s a few studies have shown that mammography coupled with ultrasound can increase the chance of finding smaller breast cancers; however other studies have shown that it does not help with specific diagnoses and can lead to false positive results the jury is out a bit on this one but some centers prefer to have both lines of diagnostic imaging to increase chance of catching a cancer
3614,bacterial vaginosis your ammonia-smelling vginal discharge could be evidence of bacterial vaginosis its not clesar how you might have gotten it  it may well clear on its own if not  metronidazole or clindamycin can clear it up do you you clinician for diagnosis and treatment plan hope that helps
3615,depends depends on if you have had a full or partial thickness mi a heart attack which damages the full thickness of the heart muscle is reliably seen on an ekg an echo will show wall motion abnormalities with either type
3616,no extremely unlikely
3617,yes nipple sparing mastectomy-where the nipple is preserved but the breast tissue is removed-is a great option for brca 2 patients prior to the surgery  cancer should be ruled out if there is cancer present  it should be away from the nipple the results can be great
3618,depends it is normal for a person to get a slightly dilated common bile duct after cholecystectomy surgery common bile duct stone would be quite unlikely a year after surgery  but possible depends on why you had surgery in the first place (gallstones or for biliary dyskinesia) chronic pain that does not resolve after gallbladder surgery may need further evaluation with your doctor or gastroenterologist
3619,look for different t they evaluate for different things and each can be complementary of each other in case of a abnormal finding on physical or mammogram
3620,not necessarily it sounds like you may have injured the elbow again it is worth having it evaluated to see what the bones  joint and ligaments look like now reserve your concern until you know what's happening some injuries don't show up on imaging when they first occur
3621,sudafed sudafed 30 mg tablets is what i recommend to my patients usually tell them to take 2 every 6-8 hours to get the most relief
3622,perhaps an ultrasound may be useful to better define a density (lump) or an area of asymmetry (shadow) seen on mammography! however  it is of no benefit when evaluating microcalcifications ideally  the breast canter where you have your diagnostic mammogram will be able to perform the ultrasound the same day  if they recommend one
3623,sinus surgery i think one week is enough
3624,close to zero cf is autosomal recessive  you need to inherit a defective copy of the gene from each parent baring spontaneous mutation or some similarly rare event  both parents need to have the gene to inherit the disease
3625,patella instability it sounds like you may have some chronic patella instability while ice  nsaids and quad strengthening may help  i would suggest an orthopedic exam she may ultimately require a surgical procedure to correct the problems if conservative treatment is not sufficient to eradicate the symptoms
3626,consider false pos urine can be tested for blood using a chemical strip dipped into the urine (dipstick) or by looking st the concentrated urine with s microscope  trying to find red blood cells the dipstick may say there is blood when the microscopic exam shows no cells also  a few red blod cells from time to time may not mean anything important--you need to know how many cells how consistently
3627,not a big worry hand-foot-and-mouth-disease is a viral rash caused by an intestinal virus (coxsackievirus) it is thought that infected individuals can shed viruses for up to 4-6 weeks keeping kids out of school is not generally recommended as the infection is generally self-limiting and is rarely serious
3628,nerve compression it sounds like you have compression of the ulnar nerve as it crosses the elbow  which is extremely common it often improves with limiting compression at the elbow  most commonly with some combination of change in habits  elbow pads  physical therapy  injection of steroids  or surgery to move the nerve out of the way
3629,difference a mammogram is a special type of xray of the breasts typically  two views of each breast are taken during the initial (screening) mammogram a breast ultrasound has no radiation and is used to evaluate a finding on a mammogram or to assess a lump felt by the patient it is able to differentiate cysts from solid masses
3630,panic possibly attenuated form of panic attack not sure if u r on medications but consult your doctor if reoccurs
3631,no not necessarily sleeping medications are not something that makes you sleep  they may help with sleep
3632,sprain/trigger/oa middle knuckle stiffness can be due to many problems  such as trigger finger  pip joint sprain or arthritis ice and anti-inflammatory medications are a good starting point for treatment if your symptoms persist  go see an orthopaedic hand surgeon
3633,could be either those symptoms actually can go with either a bacterial or viral infection strep throat is a possible bacterial cause of those symptoms there could be several viruses causing this as well someone with mild symptoms could start with supportive care with fever reducer  fluids  and rest if symptoms worsened or did not improve  one should be examined and have a strep test done
3634,nearly always a partial knee will always need to be converted to full knee after a period of time depending on the state of and demands put on the implant
3635,residual neurological changes after an uncomplicated epidural are uncommon problems are more likely related to hyperextension of the legs an evaluation by a neurologist can help identify the problem and offer you possible solutions
3636,trigger finger(s) trigger fingers and osteoarthritis commonly present with morning stiffness unlike arthritis  trigger fingers become stuck in flexion and may snap with movement triggering is due to inflammation of the tendon and tendon sheath oral/injectable steroids may resolve symptoms and therapy can be helpful sometimes surgical release of the tendon sheath is needed see an orthopaedic hand specialist
3637,finger stiffness you can try a wrist guard and avoid pressure on your hands and wrists during sleep while waiting for the hand specialist appointment i would also try oral anti-inflammatory meds in the meantime as well
3638,stress incontinence stress incontinence is a condition in which women leak urine with activity  coughing  sneezin  it occurs because of a weakness to the ligaments supporting the urethra most often it can occur as a result of childbirth but it can occur in women whom have never had children currently there are many treatment options follow up with a gynecologist  urogynecologist or urologist to discuss
3639,lots anything from a dermatofibroma to a bruise that calcified to a tendon sheath cyst to a soft tissue cancer please get the sonogram
3640,post-surgical? is this the same pain as pre-op? or is it a new pain? sounds like either the operation wasn't totally successful or a new problem has cropped up either way  see your surgeon for an opinion could be a new pinched nerve  a hardware issue with the fusion  or a nerve injury of some type is it getting better? worse? compare the pain to pre-op better or worse? all questions to discuss w/ ur surgeon
3641,wisdom teeth? sounds like a wisdom tooth problem if you havent had them removed get to a dentist to check them for you could also be from a very advanced cavity resulting in a tooth abcess
3642,no tingling and numbness in distal extremities is very suggestive of some type of peripheral neuropathy have full general check-up with your primary doc; then may need neurology consult and tests  eg nerve conduction diabetes and alcohol nerve toxicity are common causes if regular means intermittent and no sx between them  perhaps it is hyperventilation  a form of anxiety/panic attack
3643,yes it is possible and very easy to check -- do a home pregnancy test and if negative and you don't want to be pregnant use birth control including barrier contraception
3644,probably not it's probably just a dissolvable suture under the skin you can try to pick it out with some tweezers if your knee is having a lot of pain or if there is significant redness you should be seen by your orthopedist or his assistant
3645,i think breast ca physicians do speak a foreign tongue at times many patients ask me when the have spread of cancer to a bone  if they have bone cancer breast cancer cells in lung cancer are more likely breast cancer cells that have spread to the lung there would be a cancerous mass in the lung and a biopsy would show breast cancer cells this would be metastatic cancer to the lung i think that is your issue
3646,suspicious only imaging techniques other than an mri may be an indication of the level of suspicion for malignancy in the context of several other findings on history and physical examination however  a diagnosis ultimately requires a biopsy
3647,probably normal ever pregnancy is different and breast tenderness is variable  if you have confirmed the pregnancy by ultrasound and no heavy bleeding  i would not be concerned
3648,yes stress urinary incontinence is caused by relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles usually due to stretching during childbirth in women it is rare to nonexistant in males it is best initially managed using kegel exercises which can be reviewed on the internet
3649,call your md it is not a good idea to take motrin or other nsaids during pregnancy it may cause premature closure of a duct in the baby's heart if you have pain call your ob now and she can prescribe another type of medicine or you may go to urgent care
3650,multiple symptoms your best bet is consultation by a neurologist
3651,antihistamine like benadryl  ice to the area and elevation if no improvement and condition worsens head to your local emergency room
3652,it's likely that you have dense breasts  which in itself may be a br ca risk they are chasing a suspicious finding usually the u/s gives sufficient imaging to nable a biopsy  and only that proves that you do or do not have cancer mr is indicated in dense breasts it sees where mammo is blind  but it finds things that do not prove to be cancer in all instances you do not have ca until they prove it
3653,allergies ? try an antihistimine like tavist d
3654,your call that would be up to you and your instincts i never argue with patients that want another read i usually trust the radiologist and if they want to repeat in 6 months that is because they dont want to miss anything that is too early to call now sounds like they are being cautious sometimes an mri can help with a questionable lesion but they are expensive and insurance fights paying for them
3655,more info needed it´s not easy to answer that one what will be done and how  and according to whom? straightening teeth can be both for cosmetic and functional reasons cosmetic treatment may or may not involve surgery  such as orthognathic surgery is this for insurance coverage? an insurance plan may or may not cover specific procedures i wish you gave us more information for a better answer
3656,a radiculopathy sounds like a lumbar/sacral nerve is being irritated this gives you radiating pain from your low back down your posterior buttock and thigh to the foot these radiculopathies can be painful the whole way down or at any descrete location along the course of the nerve you can have pain  hot  cold   numbness  tingling   burning  or weakness get checked by your doctor
3657,anxiety you may have other anxiety issues as well as fear of physician visits  so consider psychological counseling in methods to learn to deal with anxiety issues in general
3658,call your doctor radiation induced pneumonitis is usually associated with a nagging non productive cough  i suggest you call your doctor you want to make sure there is no infection etc some times there are treated as outpatient depending on severity i suggest call you medical or radiation oncologist
3659,can mutate a mole can remain normal your whole life or it can mutate and turn into a skin cancer the carcinogenic effects of long-term uv radiation can cause mutations in the mole to form into a cancer there is also a hereditary factor that increases the risk of an individual to form skin cancer
3660,several things if you are just a primary snorer  you can try simple things  like sleeping on your back (they sell t-shirts with tennis balls on the back)  avoid alcohol and sedatives  and lose weight if you are a robust snorer  you may have a conditon called sleep apnea which can be quite serious see your md for a sleep study to determine this  and to discuss options
3661,it can especially if there is a weakness under the urethra ( tube you pee through) there are many surgical and non surgical options check out wwwvoicesforpfdorg
3662,antiinflammatory if your doctor says everything is fine and you are still having lots of pain  take your antiinflammatories like ibuprofen and advil every 6 to 8 hours for 24 hours to help minimize the inflammation then take as needed hot compress on the areas around tmj helps a lot as well good luck
3663,sinus infection the problem may be chronic sinusitis saline irrigation with a neil med sinurinse bottle might do a better job of clearing any debris a good exam by an ent  including a nasal endoscopy would best examine for the origin of bad breath sometimes your breath isn't as bad as you imagine  also
3664,tissue damage as the baby passes through the birth canal it can cause damage to the supportive tissues around the vagina  bladder  urethra and rectum in time this can lead to mobility in the urethra and leaking urine with certain activities it can also result in dropping or prolapse of the pelvic organs
3665,likely panic attacks during a panic attacks  you are likely to experience symptoms similar to a heart attack--shortness of breath  pounding/rapid heart beat  sweating  dizziness  chest pain  nausea  and some even passes out this tends to get worse because every time it happens you get scared and worry about when the next one will come it is very treatable--many effective options please consult doc good luck
3666,agree will need to see a urogyn and discuss surgery vs pessary options
3667,yes but yes as long as they don't cause drowsiness and thus affecting your alertness i usually suggest to patients to take something like fexofenadine (allegra) 180 mg during the day and whatever works for them in the evening zyrtec causes some drowsiness in slightly over 10% of the people and benadryl over 30% in my own experience
3668,very possible sinus infections can cause the upper teeth to hurt  especially the back ones combined with your other symptoms i would think you have a rather bad cold combined with a sinus infection i would visit your doctor asap for an evaluation
3669,non-food allergy pollen  grass  cat/dog and dust allergies may cause sore throat in addition to a stuffy  +/- runny nose  depending on how they affect an allergy sufferer when your nose is stuffy  it can affect your vocal quality or how you hear internal and external sounds kind of like when you have a cold
3670,many possibilities chest pain with deep breaths can be due to a number of causes  including costochondritis (a rib/cartilage pain  a rib fracture  muscular strain  a pneumothorax (partially collapsed lung)  any number of lung diseases  and even heart disease although costochondritis is common  be sure to see your doctor to rule out other more serious causes  or the er if severe pain or short of breath
3671,please take antibiotic will control infection until teeth are rx they will not cure the problem must rx the infected teeth and/or gums antibiotic must be taken exactly as directed for the full course of the antibiotic (don't quit early) glad your dentist is taking such good care of youfollow his advice to the letter

3675,first of all congratulations on your survival and i know you stopped smoking if teh simple imaging of cxr and ct are negative  and you still cough  i would get pft's  including abg and dlco i'd see a pulmonary doctor and make sure a bronchoscopy was not indicated or a pet scan highly unlikely to be related to your old disease or treatment
3676,yes things can grow on top of each other in the skin happens all the time you can get malignant things on top of benign things  benign things growing on top of other benign things  etc melanomas can also be seen right next to or even in other benign moles
3677,read instructions most  if not all  hair color agents advise a skin test for allergy to components b4 doing the hair white bumps may be dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis  that may respond to selsun blue shampoo (with selenium) or anti-fungal shampoo like nizoral try to get scalp under control b4 coloring hair & do test on skin first
3678,if pain is going?? sometimes things don't show up and we must attempt to treat what may not appear obvious but clinical judgement leads us to if all other test ruled out pathology the trigrminal nerve in the face is the most complicated nerve in the body  cause sensation  movement  and a multitude of other inervations  this nerve can cause some of your symptoms at this point you need to see if the root canal works
3679,yes  it may it is not feasible to know without examining the lesions  but if the primary subungual lesion is a melanoma  it is a malignant tumor and can spread any where in the body
3680,iud if no hormones are administered  then medication side effects don't occur discuss your contraceptive requirements with your women's health care provider

3682,could be permanent i agree with dr smith it can take months wearing compression stockings right away will help but it is essential to wear the stockings for at least wo years to help to decrease your chance that the swelling might never go away
3683,mammogram mammograms are generally better at screening for breast cancer ultrasound is used more for a focus evaluation of an area of the breast that might be suspicious or appear abnormal
3684,very different if you mean lumpectomy + radiation - the main side effects are some shrinkage of the breast in most cases and some firmness some patients have occasional breast pain  but usually not too bad if the nodes inn the armpit are removed  swelling of the arm may be a possibility
3685,it depends on how active you are and how much was done during surgery for a routine knee scope i typically allow my patients back to work in 3-4 days if they have a sedentary job otherwise  most people can start getting back to work at 2-3 weeks depending on their job strengthening of the quadriceps muscle is key as this shuts down with knee surgery of any kind most people are near full by 4 weeks
3686,sleep apnea if your child even has 1 episode an hour of sleep apnea treatment is recommended i would not wait at all  referral to have a sleep study in a children's hospital setting would be my first priority
3687,it may have moved the fracture may have moved after having seen the first doctor if it does not need surgery  follow their guidance on how to prevent further displacement
3688,no a person with a dental abcess must take antibiotics over a course of a week to suppress the bacteria causing the infection however  the abcess can be cured only extracting the tooth or undergoing a root canal procedure dental abcesses can be deadly - please seek dental care quickly
3689,it depends i have completed thousands of root canals on infected cases in one visit when a root canal is done microscopically  we can clean shape sterilize and fill canals in one visit most of the time if your nodes are swollen  you should be on an antibiotic  which your dentist will see when he examines you next sometimes when there is a longstanding lesion at the root ends  surgical removal is necessary
3690,sounds like it your description sure sounds like a sleep apnea problem you need to see your doctor asap and hopefully get referred for a sleep study so treatment can be initiated don't hesitate
3691,get it checked!!! get examined because several there are conditions such as a baker's cyst that can present themselves in the back of the knee and pinch a nerve to cause tingling in the toes you also have to rule out a more serious clot (dvt) examination and tests such as an ultrasound (doppler) would be used to diagnose
3692,femoral nerve injuries are unusual  but certainly possible you should consult a your anesthesiologist right away he should set you up with a neurologist who can evaluate the etiology and extent of the injury nerves can take a long time to heal you may also inquire about a physical therapy program good luck
3693,mammo and ultrasound are complementary tests some abnormalities may be seen on one  but not the other so a suspicious mammo finding that cannot be seen on ultrasound is still a suspicious mammo finding  and likely needs biopsy
3694,disc displacement disc displacement with reduction is usually not accompanied by pain indicating that most patients are able to adapt to the dysfunction no treatment is needed
3695,most likely noisy or grinding knees are rarely a concern unless accompanied by pain the most common cause of knee grinding is altered mechanics within the patellofemoral joint causing the backside of the kneecap to rub against the groove in the femur quadriceps weakness after acl surgery can lead to these altered biomechanics continue your rehab  with a focus on quad and hamstring strengthening
3696,1-2 weeks surgery on the hand always causes swelling the best thing you can do is to keep it elevated all of the time since most of the swelling is water and water runs downhill
3697,several things soak in warm soapy water and then use a pumice stone or callous file to remove the hard skin then use a moisturizer cream to soften the skin
3698,depends if there is a lump present then definitely yes in no mass and the pain is associated with your period  then most likely hormonakl

3701,question unclear bilateral leg swelling can have many causes whether prior cellulitis in one extremity played any role is difficult to know  but was unlikely to have been responsible for both legs congestive heart failure  lymphatic insufficiencies  venous insufficiency  and other systemic causes are more probable
3702,no there is no benefit i am aware of with antioxidants helping chemotherapy there are theoretical reasons why antioxidants can impair chemotherapies ability to kill cancer cells i would not take additional unproven supplements without a md approval or without being on a clinical trial to study it anti-oxidants have harmed people in randomized studies the won't harm  might help mantra is out
3703,no and don't do! the last thing you would want to do is dislodge carotid plaques! if it breaks off  it will follow the flow of blood and lodge in brain causing strokes the rough surface then attracts clots which can also cause stroke treatment is done by either carotid endarterectomy or stenting  as well as medical management again  a stable plaque is a small problem compared to a broken one!
3704,mole nothing can substitute clinical examination so  if you are worried about it  you need to go back to your doctor and have the mole evalated i can't tell you for sure whether it is something that you have to be cocerned about without examining the mole
3705,virus? you are most likely fighting off a virus or bacteria you should see your doctor for a full evaluation  though
3706,maybe depends on how long after surgery and how bad your nerve was damaged before the surgery by the pressure on it many surgeons give local anesthetics so it maybe numb for several days from the local if your nerve was severely damaged prior to the surgery  it will take longer to recover and tingling is often a sign of the nerve recovering this may last for up to a year
3707,you did not mention how long ago you had the surgery also  where on the foot do you have those symptoms? it may be related or may not  but more info is needed to discern you can follow up with the surgeon as he is familiar with your case
3708,see below symptoms and concerns like these mandate a thorough evaluation by your doctor only after such an evaluation  which may include labs and radiographic examinations  can he/she let you know what's going on and how best to help you
3709,complex there is almost no way to know for sure infections after surgery of different types may not equate to inguinal henia repair the institution also has a lot to do with outcomes specialty training  experience  and practice focus are all imolportant factors to consider  however you also have to feel confident with the surgeon im sorry you have to have an operation  and i hope this helps
3710,dentist or oral surg the cause of the dental abscess is the critical information that needs to be known it could be caused by an infected nerve in a tooth or also an infection in the gum tissue i agree with the other answers that you should not attempt to drain it yourself the infection could spread into the surrounding tissues and blood stream  creating more complications
3711,drainage the drainage from the sinuses and/or the antibiotic could be causing the vomiting contact your childs physician and explain to them what is going on
3712,swollen painfull gla it is better to see u pcp-for evaluation and assesment and to r/o any infection

3716,yes yes it can  there are things like gallbladder stones or different kind of cysts that can be seen and assessed much better on ultrasound versus ct scan
3717,vaginitis this may well be bacterial vaginosis  or potentially some other form of infection see your doctor  get diagnosed and treated and have a pleasant odor
3718,carpal tunnel not unique for a diabetic to have some nerve issues perhaps your median nerve is compressed over the wrist causing carpal tunnel syndrome this should be readily reversible talk to your doctor and perhaps get an emg test to evaluated the severity and decide appropriate treatment
3719,possibly a cavity in a wisdom tooth can cause jaw symptoms even in absence of temporomandibular disorders consult a dentist before symptoms get worse
3720,advice look  a fever means infection usually a urinary tract infection doesn't have fever fever means the infection is moving up the urinary tract could be you have a kidney infection don't mess with this could lead to an infection in the blood  damaged kidneys and loss of work advice: get it checked out losing work with cost you more now  high tail it to your doc!

3724,probably not hyperkinetic or hyperactive gallbladder is not generally accepted as a diagnosis a small group of patients (63) was symptomatic with cck infusion with greater than 80% ejection fraction 28 of these patients underwent removal of gall bladder 97% of these 28 patients showed improvement in symptoms following surgery more prospective and retrospective studies neededto substantiate the findings
3725,probably not unless your serum pregnancy test was done way too early  you are not pregnant based on it being negative if you are still in doubt  repeat urine pregnancy in 2 weeks if negative  go back to your routine  however  make sure if you wait 2 weeks until the next pregnancy test  you use an alternative reliable method of contraception  such as abstinence or condoms
3726,return to doctor possible referred pain from a tooth in lower arch  the lower arch has a branch of the trigeminal nerve that goes up the side of the jaw in front of the ear return to dentist to be revaluated
3727,yes some people will find that nasal saline irrigation is more effective than prescription medication different delivery devices can be found at your local pharmacy and your pharmacist may actually be able to help you choose the right device for you
3728,no these vaccines ( several companies make it) are made in the lab by synthesizing material that mimics the shell of the hepatitis virus when given  your body can begin making blocking antibodies as if you were invaded by the real thing it is not a living product & you cannot give it to anyone
3729,see dr may be your gallbladder
3730,us vs mammo it depends on what you mean by effective the sensitivity of screening mammo and screening us is close  with us detecting 3-4 cancers per 1000 patients and mammo detecting 4-5us performs better in the dense breast category  mammo performs better in fatty breasts their roles are complementary  and evolving the current main role of us is to further evaluate abnormalities seen on mammo or exam
3731,no the acl is the primary restraint that prevents the shin bone (tibia) from sliding forward from beneath the thigh bone (femur) when the acl is torn you develop unwanted pathologic anterior knee instability the hamstrings are the secondary restraints strengthening them will minimize but not eliminate anterior knee instability following an acl tear
3732,see your surgeon clicking in knee replacements is very common as the parts are metal and plastic(polyethylene) popping may indicate some swelling or fluid build up in the knee you should see your knee surgeon or knee replacement specialist to have it evaluated
3733,no most patients respond well to exercise  bracing and anti-inflammatory medications very few eventually need surgery
3734,yes usually you can see tumors that have spread to the lungs on an x-ray however  you can have stage 4 cancer without there being any cancer in the lungs i had a patient once who had stage 4 kidney cancer and her lungs were totally fine
3735,see a doctor you need to see a regular doctor to confirm the diagnosis and to start oral antibiotics

3741,culture wound or drainage needs to be cultured
3742,the the best initial breast biopsy is a needle biopsy it usually allows the diagnosis to be made in the least invasive way many women who have a needle biopsy will not need to have a surgical biopsy for women who do get a recommendation for a surgical biopsy  having the results of the needle biopsy allows the surgeon to individualize the operation to the patient's circumstances
3743,yes to 1st ? a core needle biopsy is a special needle that is larger and takes large pieces of breast tissue it is very accurate plain needle biopsy is probably referring to a fine needle biopsy this is a smaller needle and does not get actual pieces of breast tissue it gets cells for cytology which is not as accurate as a core biopsy
3744,great great question no  angioplasty and stent placement are only mechanical fixes for the underlying obstruction only through controlling cholesterol  diabetes  high blood pressure  taking aspirin  stopping smoking  exercising  and losing weight can you prevent plaque from forming again this is why the medications you take after angioplasty/stent placement are so very important for your long term heart health they are really the only ways to hopefully prevent future procedures
3745,too many drugs here the combination of all this medication is not a good option in my opinion and i don't believe increasing doses of any individual one of these will help you sleep any better i like the idea of working toward nonpharmacological ways to approach your insomnia before using all these agents again  speaking to your doctor before changing would be best but ultimately  i think for you  less is more
3746,you you had a singnificant reaction to what bite you you should see an md to make sure that it is not an infection  however

3748,i i can't answer your concerns without seeing you please make an appt with a dermatologist to be examined most of the time things are ok
3749,swelling after facel yes the risk of swelling (prolonged) would be higher this should not preclude surgery but be prepared for a longer convalescence

3755,no if all of your treatment is completed as you are followed by your oncology team with breast exams  mammograms and md breast exams  pet scan will offer little to no benefit there r also some blood markets that can be used to evaluate for early recurrence and this merit additional studies routinely though after treatment for an early stage breast cancers do not require pet scan for surveillance
3756,likely migraine if you have had even off and on so called  normal headaches which in reality are mild headaches  in the past  then most probably you are having migraine headaches your family members may also have headaches of less or more severity
3757,this this is likely related to your allergy as the others have noted would not do anything to the bubble as you may cause problems would see an opthalmologist  not an optometrist  as already mentioned would get eye drops like patanol or pataday or an antihistamine eye drop from an allergist or the eye md
3758,an an ac separation can occur with negative xrays for fracture a grade ! separation may not show any xray findings a higher grade injury may only be apparent with a weight holding film a more severe injury may show that physically there is a notch  bump or step off at the ac joint even if the radiologist read the xray as negative the ac joint is stressed if one brings their arm across their chest trying to touch the opposite shoulder this ois called adduction of the arm elevation will also be a problem  if the ac joint is sprained even a low grade injury may take 4-5 weeks or more to feel better tennis  especially overhead shots may take longer it sound as if an evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon who takes care of shoulder problems is needed
3759,have have you spoken to your doctor or the person covering him? one needs to look at the rash and have more info  to give you the best answer
3760,there there are many problems that can cause your symptoms  as the other docs mentioned allergy is a little less likely  because it usually affects both eyes at the same time for temporary relief  use some over-the-counter tear drops  or a 'get-the-red-out' drop for one or 2 days if your vision is blurry  or if you have pain or increasing swelling  you should see medical care immediately
3761,the the mitral valve closes when the heart beats to prevent blood from flowing backwards into the lungs when the mitral valve does not close properly one of the two leaflets of the valve may protrude beyond the other leaflet this is called mitral valve prolapse in most cases  it is harmless and patients are unaware that they have it up to 10% of the population has some mitral valve prolapse  but it generally does not affect them prolapse can lead to a situation wherein blood will leak backwards through the valve this is called mitral regurgitation mitral valves that have an abnormal structure can raise the risk for infection on the valve an echocardiogram is usually the best test for assessing mitral valve abnormalities generally a heart murmur suggests some degree of regurgitation most patients with mitral valve prolapse do not have symptoms and treatment is not needed
3762,age age is generally not a limiting factor in the success of a hair transplant if you have healthy hair on the sides and/or back of your scalp  you're a good candidate for a hair transplant i hope things go well!

3765,get it looked at the ingrown part of the nail is not always visible try soaking your foot in warm water  removal of embedded debris from the nail borders  and applying an antibiotic ointment to temporarily soften the corners if you have redness and drainage  get it looked at by a professional  as you may need to have the ingrown nail border removed you may need antibiotics
3766,yes after a lumpectomy and whole breast radiation  there is a 12-15% chance that breast cancer will come back in the same breast within 5 years however  the chance of recurrence is much higher without radiation therapy
3767,yes if it comes back as just one lesion then radiosurgery is indicated if it comes back more extensively then chemotherapy and or hormonal therapy is needed in this situation radiation can be used to help any symptoms from the cancer that came back
3768,see neurologist your history is too nonspecific to confirm ms  but one white matter lesion may be a clue repeat mri in 6 months if your problems continue  new lesions  especially gadolinium positive  could confirm ms if you lack confidence in current physician  get a second opinion
3769,different strokes some people have more extensive surgery than others that's like saying 2 people  both with broken legs  have different rxone has a walking cast  the other a cast from toes to hip your oral surgeon will go over pain management instructions with you follow those instructions to the letter and you should be ok hope you do better than your friend
3770,abscess & antibiotic for the most part an untreated cavity is a common cause of tooth abscess as the cavity erodes the enamel  it works its way into the inside of the tooth creating an abscess/pus pocket a root canal is the only way to remove the infection and save the tooth when ignored  this infection spreads to the surrounding jawbone and the tooth become hopeless and extraction is indicated
3771,yes  but especially if other teeth have moved to allow room impacted means that something was blocking eruption now that tooth is coming in you may have soreness from eruption (think teething) or from irritated gum tissue around the tooth now that you are having a problem please go back to see your dentist for resolution or referral
3772,yes i'm sorry your breast cancer came back yes  chemo and radiation have both improved in the last 13 years radiation is more targeted with new techniques  and there are many more chemotherapy drugs to choose from that are less toxic medications to prevent side effects like nausea are also greatly improved
3773,very very difficult to tell without a clinical examination it could be eczema  psoriasis  stasis dermatitis  or many other conditions i would recommend you see a dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment options read a little more about eczema and psoriasis at the link below (including pictures) i hope that helps
3774,just just so that we start off answering this question by the book you should know that the current trend is to discredit the long lasting value of re-treating root canal treated teeth in favor of extraction and implant replacement therapy that being said i want to express my confidence in the capabilities of experienced competent endodontists (root canal specialists) if you were in los angeles i would refer you to one of my colleagues like dr etessami as far as nerve damage during endodontic surgery is concerned  he would tell you that he has not encountered one single case of parasthesia (numbness) in 26 years of practice and he must have performed over 10  000 surgeries in which 2000 have been lower posterior teeth in regards to the prognosis and longevity of the tooth and surgery vs implant (or extraction) i would need to see the x-ray as a regular re-treatment should not be overlooked either sometimes surgery is not necessary so to answer your question  please get a second or third opinion dr neil mcleod dentistry that lasts - quality that counts
3775,trachea still cf the graft of new lungs does leave a trachea that still has the cf defect this can serve as a source of infection to the new lungs the new transplanted lungs though will not have cf disease
3776,the the removal of breast implants is dependent on whether the scar capsule surrounding these implants is also going to be removed  the actual removal without capsulectomy (scar removal) is relatively quick  but is also dependent on whether or not there is a leaking silicone implant versus a saline implant the removal of silicone can take a bit longer than saline
3777,if if your infection has been treated and then the abcess has returned  you need to go back to the dentist who is treating you so that he/she can evaluate your condition it is possible that you need additional antibiotics to clear up your infection and allow your dentist to treat your problematic tooth

3780,to to begin  strokes are not that common a cause of headache  although it depends a bit on what is meant by stroke the majority of strokes are infarcts  death of brain tissue from loss of blood supply  and these more often than not are not associated with headache the other major kind of stroke is hemorrhage  and those often have headaches  often sudden and severe other causes of severe headache with neurological deficits such as slurred speech or dizziness can include brain tumors  brain vascular diseases such as vasculitis or arteriovenous malformations  or even leaking aneurysms you should definitely see a neurologist to be evaluated for the cause of your symptoms and signs  and promptly  as these may be warning signs of a serious but treatable condition which  left alone  could be disabling or even fatal
3781,the the knot you described in your breast sounds like a cyst  which can increase in size if you consume a lot of caffeine these cysts often tend to hurt right before your period as far as breast cancer screening goes  for women who have a first degree relative (your mother in this case) with breast cancer  then screening for them would start ten years before the age your mother was when she was diagnosed for instance if your mother was diagnosed at age 40  your screening would start at age 30 if your doctor is not following this protocol  then you should seek another opinion all the best
3782,this this is a good question when your teeth are cleaned it is entirely possible that the hygienist has worked below the gum line to remove calculus  the tarter that accumulates when the plaque in not removed efficiently and and becomes calcified the instruments that penetrate below the gum displace the tissue and they are used to scrap off the calculus and the lining of the gum pocket is stretched and scraped this will produce an inflammatory response  and one of the five signs of inflammation is tumor from the latin which means swelling there i think that answers your question dr neil mcleod dds dentistry nthat lasts - quality that counts
3783,pain happens after most surgical procedures in mastectomy  a nerve that exits the side of the breast is usually injured or sacrificed and irritation of is causes pain or noxious tingling especially when the arms swing during walking swelling is independent of that and can be caused by removal of lymph nodes and exacerbated by not putting the limb thru frequent adequate range of motion- usually out of fear of pain
3784,maybe recurrence after radiation most often means mastectomy unfortunately  after radiation for breast cancer  the tissue is changed in a way that limits the options for reconstruction ordinarily the simplest method uses a tissue expander followed by an implant  but radiated tissue doesn't expand well and capsular contracture is common flaps such as diep or tram are preferable in that instance
3785,low grade it's not really a fever but if you haven't passed the stone by now you should follow up for other options
3786,yes! yes! a pacifier is the lesser of the two evils 1) the thumb transfer the weight of the whole arm and leverages off the lower front teeth to exert an upward pressure against the palate changing the shape of the palate 2) orthodontic pacifiers are available that are flatter than your child's thumb that will cause less distortion of her front teeth 3) you can wean her off the pacifier and eventually take it away my grandchildren helped pack them up and brought the to the mailbox to send them to a nonexistent younger child

3788,hello hello although i can't diagnose your condition  the description sounds like possible sciatica i would contact your doctor so that he or she can evaluated for this and determine what type of treatment would be best
3789,you you may wish to consider medical acupuncture it can be very helpful for neuropathy by helping to mobilize stagnating blood  lymph  electricity (nerves) and qi it can also be helpful for joint damage it is very non-intrussive and safe
3790,you you do not provide enough information to give a concise answer on how you are being treated hopefully this infection was drained and a small drain placed in your mouth to keep the site open this will allow the infection to drain into your mouth instead of tracking deeper into your tissues where it will be harder to treat or out onto your face where it can leave a scar i am not sure how the tooth is going to be fixed  is suspect a root canal  but if the infection does not clear soon with antibiotics i would recommend it be evaluated for extraction before bigger problems develop
3791,this this is indicative that there is an active infection is present in the mouth the fact that the infection is draining indicates that your body is mounting a response to the infection as the pus is a collection of white blood cells that have come to the site of the infection to fight it the fact that the infection is draining into the mouth lessens the possibility that it will spread deeper into the tissues once the source of the infection is removed the combination of the your body's natural defense mechanisms and the antibiotics should adequately fight the infection you need to take antibiotics for 7 to 10 days to get the proper benefit it is not unusual to not be able to drain an infection early in the process there may not be any pus (white blood cells) yet instead the swelling is due to cellulitis which is a diffuse accumulation of fluids in the infected tissue even though there is no pus  i will typically try to surgically enter the infected area an place a drain for a few days this does two thing first it creates a pathway to direct future drainage away from deeper tissues and vital structures secondly  there are some bacterial that cannot live in the presence of oxygen by draining the area we are introducing more oxygen deeper into the tissues to help kill these anaerobic bacteria
3792,cracked cracked teeth are a challenge to diagnose an endodontist is a good place to start  as they see this routinely a tooth sleuth helps or a bite adjustment  and if so it likely will need a crown and maybe even a root canal
3793,if if symptoms are not improving or ameliorated within one week despite conservative measures such as a neti pot /sinus irrigation and decongestants  you probably should be seen if the pain is progressing  or the drainage is purulent ( malodorous and pus-like) you should be seen sooner for initiation of antibiotic therapy a neti pot will not treat an infectious cause for sinonasal complaints  it merely removes particulate and secretory matter  and often affords symptomatic relief for mild congestive/inflammatory symptoms
3794,depends on the cause many things can cause calluses some reasons that one may develop a callus include: viral infections (warts)  friction  pressure  repedetive trauma  and a limitation of joint motion some genetic conditions may also cause people to develop calluses on the hands and the feet treatment depends on the cause of the problem have it evaluated by a professional and get the appropriate treatment
3795,return to sport a lot depends on what the surgeon finds  the surgery/procedure performed and your recovery from physical therapy for a routine knee scope with partial meniscectomy you may be able to return to sport at the 4-6 week mark; for a meniscal repair this may take up to 4 months
3796,headaches - hair a headache on the top of the head and where the hair is painful is commonly a muscular contraction headache and must be dealt with from a neuromuscular orientation the dental bite must be set properly (vertical dimension mostly) and the trigger points in the splenious capitus and scm muscles must be treated properly i like travell trigger point technique as it has helped patients 30 years
3797,get seen now there are several possible causes of your symptoms  including dvt (blood clot)   problem with arterial circulation  post operative swelling  or even nerve irritation any unexpected symptom after recent surgery deserves immediate attention  so a serious complication can be quickly avoided call your surgeon!
3798,pain this sounds like a great case for orthotics see your podiatrist and you will be   well   amazed at what can be accomplished with them
3799,acute infection or? as immunologists we get questions about what does it mean to have igg and igm antibodies igg antibody levels indicate an immunity resulting from past exposure to an infectious agent igm antibodies are produced during the acute stage if you are positive for igg antibodies to herpes simplex that means that you had past exposure if igm antibodies are present  it indicates current infection
3800,possible if you can see your nail going into your skin and when you touch your toenail it hurts  then you have an ingrown toenail if the toe is just red  swollen and painful it could be gout go see a podiatrist for further evaluation
3801,yes!!! after lumpectomy radiation plays a key role in decreasing the risk of local recurrence in the breast after lumpectomy this is a seperate effect than that of chemotherapy without radiation your local recurrence could be 3-4 times higher if you fail locally because of foregoing radiation  this may put you at risk for metastatic disease as well please talk to your oncologist and finish treatment
3802,odds are low most doctors think tumor until proven otherwise if your doctors are not thinking tumor  they are probably confident there is no tumor many other causes need to be considered infection  toxicity  hypertension  metabolic imbalance  migraine variant all must be considered
3803,not good maybe due to colitis or infection are some foods making it worse ? try going gluten free for a week to see if symptoms improve if not then rec a gi doctor to eval
3804,treatment i recommend you speak with your oncology team about options you may also want to get a 2nd opinion at a university based hospital chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy will be the most likely options offered to her this depends on how much metastasis is present
3805,xanax not the best xanax is commonly prescribed for anxiety  but it can cause anxiety if used more than occasionally it can be addicting do not use xanax if you've had drug/alcohol problems cognitive behavioral therapy is by far the best treatment for anxiety learn a relaxation skill like mindfulness of medications  antidepressants like zoloft or celexa usually work well with few side effects
3806,no when we start treatment of anxiety we start with 5mg  may be 10 mg and we titrate up to 20mg ( 5mg every 6 days)  then we observe and asses as we go most people eventually need at least 40 mg daily to regulate their anxiety i totally don't recommend xanax  if absolutely necessary  then klonopin can start at 025mg am and pm may up to total of 05mg twice daily
3807,no you should have your hcg level followed till it is down to 0 a period likely won't occur for one to two months
3808,amox may not be work if no better in 1-2 days meds may not be workingcall your doctor
3809,work with cancer there is no contraindication to working during therapy!
3810,difficult to know this is the location for the epitrochlear lymph nodes  but this could just as easily be an epidermal inclusion cyst (sebaceous cyst) or a lipoma (fatty tumor) or something more serious i would suggest you have it evaluated if you are concerned
3811,most likely there are new techniques to bridge the defect  depends on individual cases get a second opinion
3812,it shouldnt a hydrocelectomy is a relatively benign and common procedure that is performed as an outpatient surgery it should not affect your functioning long term risks of surgery include bleeding  infection  and damage to structures nearby the testicle
3813,see your doc if you had bright red rectal blood (and you're sure it was rectal and not menstrual) then you need to see your doc (especially if you didn't when it first started) lots of things can cause rectal bleeding  ranging from hemorrhoids to fissures to cancers rectal bleeding is never normal and always needs to be checked out
3814,get checked out sounds like it could be strep i'd get a culture to be sure
3815,clindo your dentist is smart to switch antibiotics to help prevent bacterial resistance and address the possibility of bacteria that amoxicillin does not kill take an antacid for your heart burn
3816,nothing to worry the recovery period is usually unremarkable the first few days the patient may require some soft diet due to discomfort with swallowing liquids should be tepid rather than too hot or cold there may be some visible coating in the beds where tonsills used to be he may need to take some ibuprofen to help reduce the postoperative pain and inflammation
3817,unusual this unusual follow up with surgeon
3818,possible surgery i prescribe therapy  nsaids  weight loss (if necessary) and possible bracing and steroid shots first if you fail this  then surgery may be needed
3819,factors many factors are involved: age  immune system  type of tumor  gender in certain cases  type of chemotherapy   compliance among many others your oncologist is the best guide
3820,may be infection may be you have an abscess of the face  but it needs to be checked to make diagnosis  it be something else as well
3821,stomatitis it could be viral see an ent
3822,change diet try to avoid fried and fast food and alcohol and take in more leafy greens and non processed food try some exercise like walking consider getting a mono test and if persists see a doctor
3823,seepmd better to consult pmd
3824,possble but i would suggest seeing the dentist who removed your tooth or a dentist who specializes in facial pain it could also be something else and should be diagnosed
3825,if doctor calls if you have new breast masses  you should have the mammogram +/- breast ultrasounds asap ask your physician to call the mammogram center to see if s/he can get you in sooner also  ask the mammography unit to put you on their wait lists in case any one cancels i would also recommend seeing a breast surgeon for evaluation as well
3826,yes a small umbilical hernia can be present and not felt or seen but most surgeons can detect them by feeling it's more difficult if people are very heavy
3827,maybe if this is your first period since stopping depo then it could be normal there can be a lot of lining of the uterus to shed and if the cramping is bad you can get nausea and vomiting however if you've had periods recently that aren't this bad then there's a chance you have an infection then you want to see a doctor
3828,jaw pain you refer to previous infection with your wisdom tooth even though it seems fine  your jaw pain could reflect a problem with that wisdom tooth  such as a cyst or an infection in the jaw bone i would recommend you see an oral and maxillofacial surgeon in consultation to determine what the problem is and what would be in your best interest good luck!
3829,need more testing a noncontrast ct is a good screening exam for many conditions  but may not be as sensitive as mri you should be examined by a neurologist  and if he feels that it is warranted  a contrast mri study will afford a more precise diagnosis
3830,possibly symptoms like these are best deterimed by a thorough evaluation by your physician based on his/her findings  a treatment plan can be developed to help you
3831,joint dysfunction your left tmj likely has medial (to the midline) displacement of the cartilage disc this allows the joint to be further up in the socket  hence the jaw shift the noise is the cartilage disc snapping back into place when opening without examination the growth cannot be commented on  so a visit to dentist or dermatologist is warranted
3832,yes sentinel node biopsy can be done prior to breast surgery for a variety if reasons  such as before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (to stage patients) before mastectomy (to determine if radiation is needed or reconstruction can be done)  etc it is not commonly done to help decide between lumpectomy and mastectomy  so it is important to review how the sln results would impact your decision
3833,breast cancer multiple clinical trials over decades show that lumpectomy alone is not adequate treatment for most (not all) patients  because there is often more cancer cells in the breast  beyond the lump
3834,nasal congestion yes this is possible you should see a doctor for an examination and proper treatment
3835,kneecap irritation if the pain is anterior it sounds like patellofemoral pain or cartilage wear under kneecap if it is at the joint line may be meniscus tear if no pain or clicking or catching in the knee sounds like the former
3836,classic tmj in the absence of swelling  the fact that you can not open your mouth wide indicates that the muscles the open your mouth are involved which normally indicates a tmj problem your teeth may be mis aligned which may be the reason you can't bite your teeth together  you need to see a dentist for an exam to treat this condition and to rule out an abscess with xrays
3837,yes symptoms of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can have similarities as well as differences nonetheless  it is possible to have either despite having a negative ra or lupus test no medical test is ever 100% accurate every time as there are false positives and false negatives in medicine  we have a saying  we are treating patients  not lab results however  keep exploring other poss diagnoses
3838,ok  let's see  do u sleep well at night? clinch or grind teeth at night? wake up with your hands numb? is pain in lower  upper or mid back? was there an injury? any medical problems one thing to consider is hand splints at night in case it's carpal tunnell syndrome folate deficiency is a rare source the hand and arm pain may be seperate or relegated to back and headaches let's do private conv if this fits u
3839,let it settle i'm really sorry that you seem to have made your psoriasis worse with the phony apple cider vinegar cure get back with your dermatologist  confess everything  and get treated scientifically once again
3840,may be the change in the alignment of the teeth or the open bite appearance on the panoramic may indicate a broken jaw broken jaw from oral surgery procedure is very rare! cone beam ct probably would be a film of choice!
3841,accuracy melanoma starts out flat  when elevated t is potentially fatal  depending upon thickness
3842,see below i am inclined to go with the dentist since he can feel your jaw clicking there are many treatments for tmj speak to your dentist
3843,less likely typically skin cancer changes  size  color  shape etc it is worth to see a skin doctor to confirm
3844,right leg only? if i understand  the abnormal findings are in only one leg could be a mono neuritis multiplex  but how about a lesion in the sciatic nerve such as a piriformis syndrome diabetics can get metabolic unilateral radiculopathies (amyotrophies) a search for the true location and causation can be indeed very fruitful
3845,sinus infection this could be a number of things from the flu  to a cold to a sinus infection if you also have a specific tooth that is hurting  it could be infected as well you probably would be best seen by your physician if the symptoms worsen or are not better in a day or two unless you have the toothache and then your dentist could take care of it
3846,yes snoring @ 2 is a bit unusual & will likely get worse as the tonsils & adenoids grow faster than the kid at this age if you notice pauses >10 seconds in snoring & the kid naps a lot during the day when the other kids are playing  it is time to pursue an ent evaluationthe iron issue is unrelated but could aggravate the symptoms
3847,see your doctor among several possibilities is a kidney stone you should contact your primary care doctor or ob/gyn
3848,yes but your pregnancy test should be positive 2 weeks after the iui or intercourse it is likely you are not pregnant but if it does turn out positive later  it might not be from the iui
3849,acl instability after acl reconstruction can be for a number of reasons such as non healed meniscus repair  hardware failure  even simply lack of strength i would see our orthopedist or seek a second opinion if your knee remains unstable despite surgery
3850,not a miscarriage if your pregnancy tests are negative then you are not pregnant so it can not be a miscarriage  it sounds like you are having a period
3851,immune evaluation i believe you warrant an immune evaluation to find out if a immune defect is the cause for your refractory sinusitis see a board/certified allergist
3852,bleaching creams some bleaching creams are associated with an increased risk of skin cancer particularly when combined with extensive sun exposure or uv radiation also it is important to k ow the history of the mole such as the abcd (see diagram) and risks of malignancy
3853,ppp likely are pearly penile papules  which are harmless see: http://pppremovalhubpagescom/hub/pearly-penile-papules-ppp-removal-treatments -- for more information and options on treatment  if desired
3854,mole pathologists do not usually miss melanoma  sometimes difficult lesions are hard to classify however in your case the proper therapy depends on the clinical and pathologic diagnosis if the lesion was normal  no further therapy is needed if the lesion was a dysplastic nevus  it should be re-excised depending on the severity of the dysplasia excision is the usual treatment it is not excessive
3855,elevate your leg swelling may persist for an extended period if the cellulitis was severe add an ace wrap as well
3856,swelling as stated it could be normal and it could be dvt  the right thing to do is see your surgeon to get it checked
3857,difficult sometimes i presume hiatal hernia the symptoms can be very similar that is why we have testing discuss with your doctor keep  track of time  place  severity  stimulating events for your discomfort usually a heart attack will really get your attention
3858,not typical white fingers are not at all typical of carpal tunnel they would be more associated with a vascular or rheumatological condition
3859,no but no but if you are clenching  your masseter muscles may be enlarged and tender  simulating parotid enlargement and pain
3860,small risk the risk is delayed by about 15 to 20 years but even after 20 years  the risk is extremely small obviously  we don't want to get cts for no reason  but if you need one  i would not worry about a tumor afterwards
3861,no a simple breast cyst or cyst with a single thin septation is very common and does not require biopsy or follow up if it has a more suspicious feature (such a internal nodule  thick septation  etc)  then biopsy would be preferable to follow up if a breast cyst is benign in appearance  it can still be therapeutically drained under ultrasound guidance to relieve symptoms
3862,hard knocks of life as long as he is acting normal  i wouldn't worry use cold compresses to reduce the swelling
3863,yes the failure rate of any antibiotic in otitis media runs around 5% for 1st treatment cycle with increasing failure rates for each successive round for that infection it may have worked initially while another resistant germ moved in & started a new infection recheck & re-treatment may be needed  or the fever could be from another issue
3864,see doctor it is not possible to tell what this is from brief description  coukd be cyst with opening or you coukd have 2 separate things in same area dermatologist will diagnose and remove if necessary
3865,residual nail when toe pain persists after ingrown toenail removal  i am suspicious whether a nail spicule was left even the best doctor can sometimes miss a small nail fragment another possibility is infection  either of the skin or underlying bone either way  have it checked by your podiatristdon't play doctor
3866,no problem only way to rule out colon cancer is an occasional colonoscopy get plenty of god made food and leave the junk alone
3867,yes changing position can cause an infection if the surrounding skin/tissue is not clean
3868,depend on what it is you need to get more evaluation definitely  a repeat mammogram should be done as well as an ultrasound of the breast biopsy to the mass will be the best thing to really tell you what the nodule is- whether it is malignant or benign judging from the size  if this were a malignant nodule- providing there is no evidence of spreading anywhere- it is curable you need to know first what it is
3869,just observe your symptoms are common after a mild closed head injury i assume you had a normal ct of the head during your hospital stay avoid strenuous activity and slow down until your symptoms resolve if the symptoms worsen  change significantly of persist for more than 7-10 days  i would recommend that you follow up with your doctor and consider a repeat ct of the head
3870,in general nothing! creatine is highly touted supplement used as a performance enhancer in general  any such ped carries some risk  even over the counter i recommend you not take anything!eat well  maybe add more protein and be cautious with carbs  and stay well-hydrated you can get strength and mass with a good  well-designed work-out without supplements
3871,oxygen oxygen helps cluster headaches if that is what u have
3872,probably not tumor the chances that you have a brain tumor after four months after a negative had scanned are very very low the headaches and symptoms you're feeling may be simple migraine headaches unrelated to any tumor it is worth your time to see a neurologist to evaluate the headaches if they continue
3873,not typical if it's your first time taking trazedone  that would be my first suspect if not  it could be the zoloft  or just coincidence headache is not one of the common side effects of zoloft
3874,can't answer i am not implying that this is a clandestine process rather  the senior surgeon is present an directs every part of the case  that is  he/she ensures that your operation was done exactly as he/she would have done it
3875,it is ok see womenshealth govand radiologyinfoorg under mammogram
3876,positive pregnancy additional information would be needed to determine things like health or due date a 48 hr repeat blood test and a 6+ week sonogram
3877,xrays  maybe mri start with a visit to your primary care provider x-rays of the lower leg may be appropriate  depending on the history and physical exam findings a sports medicine or orthopedics consult may also be useful if more imaging is necessary  an mri  or possibly a bone scan or ct would be more appropriate than pet
3878,really a pimple? the question is whether it's really a pimple i you are worried that you may have been exposed to an std  seek care from your gynecologist for a thorough examination  testing and a good conversation about your risk factors consider the choices you are making in your sexual expression always honor and respect yourself you are worth it!
3879,possibly you do not mention what technique was done  but if you lifted something and tore a stitch  it could be a problem the gas and bloating could be normal  but if it seems worse  be seen by your surgeon
3880,yesterday's answers yesterday when you asked this question most of the doctors who answered felt that keloids or scar tissue were the most likely cause another physician thought it might be genital warts without an exam we probably can not confirm this scar tissue is certainly possible after a biopsy perhaps a dermatologist would be your next stop they can review your biopsy result and examine the area
3881,many possibilities all my colleagues gave you reasonable possibilities and i agree with them what is important is that you should be feeling better each day and the dentist who actually extracted the tooth should be the best one to know what is the most likely cause of your pain and about how long it should take to go away if not  consider seeing another dentist for second opinion
3882,meniscus you may have a meniscus tear consult your surgeon to see if that's a possibility
3883,could be one of the classic signs of cancer is a change in mole or freckle certainly  you should have this checked out you need to be ever vigilant with your complexion use an spf 15-30 skin creme  wear a hat  and avoid long exposures to sun good luck
3884,could be the athletes foot
3885,botox you may want to consider having your doctor/headache specialist see if botox can be approved for your migraine headaches if it works you could have significantly less migraines for at least 3-4 months at a time many times people's migraines are cut in half if not more the use of your oral migraine prevention medications and abortives are much more helpful and reduce occurrences even better
3886,may need orthotics see a podiatrist for a recommendation on if orthotics could be right for you if you want to try an over-the-coubter product first  try spenco total support http://wwwspencocom/products/footcare/total-support-insoles insoles i would try this before surgery
3887,usually your muscles most often at that age  mechanical strains and related conditions (it band  patellofemoral syndrome  muscle pulls etc) are to blame  particularly in patients with high loads  eg athletes  the obese much more rare are rheumatologic or serious orthopedic conditions these problems are much easier to diagnose through examination; a good primary or sports med provider should be able to sort it out
3888,leave it alone baby acne is felt to be triggered by babies high level of maternal hormone levels that sustained the pregnancy & prepaired for breast feeding clamping the cord cuts off new hormone input  but leaving the wet spa of pregnancy puts baby in contact with skin irritants and germs the process accelerates for a while before peaking & the intensity varies eventually the hormones & acne are gone
3889,probably ok it is unlikely that jeans can ever create the degree of compression needed to affect circulation  and we in fact use compression to help treat patients with dvt
3890,not tmj tmj unrelated to swollen lymph nodes see ent surgeon to work up swollen nodes possible to have concurrent but unrelated tmj problem
3891,see below just because you have false teeth doesn't mean for a second you couldn't have tmj dissorders in fact it is very possible if you dentures are old and worn out then you are over-occluding and can cause stresses that are unnatural and damaging to those jointsthough this may not be the cause of your prob  it would be a good idea to see your dental provider for a check up
3892,as above i think it is important to see u pcp for reevaluation and to eliminate all none essential medication
3893,it's not good! most likely scenarios are infection from decayed tooth that abscessed and the infection is trying to escape to the outside of your gums  or a gum infection from long standing calculus and periodontal (gum) disease there are other possibilities whatever it is  it could be dangerous  will not get better on its own and needs immediate attention see your dentist asap for diagnosis and treatment
3894,possible unfortunately  though rare  you can still develop a clot even on medication the filter doesn't prevent clot it just prevents it from shooting up to the lung
3895,several things this is one of those problems where a visit to your doctor is necessary to figure out what's going on you may need a testicular ultrasound
3896,neuritis /tendinitis it is important to perform a complete lower extremity history and physical examination there could be several different diagnosis for this condition each lower extremity system (integument  vascular  neurological and musculoskeletal) should be thoroughly evaluated oncea proper diagnosis can be established  then a treatment plan can be implanted
3897,not sure this is not normal though pain and swelling are generally signs of trauma or infection see a doctor
3898,go to doctor go see a doctor immediately now airway obstruction of any kind is bad and serious  and the cause needs to be diagnosed and treated asap if you can't breathe  you die add in all the other symptoms and it is only that much more serious do not waste your time on the internet go see a doctor!
3899,herceptin that chemo agent can cause weakness of the heart muscle and if your ejection fraction is only 42% then your doctor is being appropriately cautious
3900,could be angina you need to be checked by a cardiologist your symptoms could be from another blocked artery do it soon
3901,healthy eating/exerc natural supplements that i would recommend are the daily and ample use plant based foods instead of animal based foods(fats and meats) encourage her to eat veggies and fruits with each mealthese together should constutute half of her plate of foodthis is a good guideline daily exercise in the form of walking is also importantaim for a minimum of 30 minutes  on at least on 5 days a week
3902,plz c breast surgeon while a normal mammogram is reassuring  as many as 10% of cancers will not be seen by mammography therefore  if you have a palpable lump  you should be seen by a breast surgeon using a combination of physical examination  ultrasound  +/- biopsy  they will get to the bottom of this don't delay!
3903,sounds muscular! with all the tests and your age  it must be weight training related muscles tighten after exercise there are many muscles in the upper chest area that can do this take an aleve several hours before working out  and see if improves or lessened
3904,yes most certainly a sore thraqot with eustachian tube issues and ear infection could be viral  but could be bacterial have your doctor look at it!
3905,family prac your dr needs to find out why you are getting frequent uti's have them do a culture on a urine sample do a bladder scan and possibly see an urologist
3906,talk w/your doctor your own physician is carrying out a careful evaluation of your complaints  and this is in process ulcerative colitis and other causes are possible with these symptoms please continue to work with your doctor on these issues so you can get any treatment you may need hopefully your colon will be examined too good luck to you
3907,abnormal nerve neuropathy is a condition resulting from abnormal nerve function neuropathy can be due to certain vitamin deficiencies  nerve damage due to trauma  alcohol consumption  radiation  side effects of certain medications  or due to certain medical conditions such as diabetes treatment varies depending on the cause of the problem have it evaluated and appropriately treated
3908,see a podiatrist corns are callouses on the toes and are caused mainly by shoe irritation over a period of time they can just be trimmed by a podiatrist  but will usually come back the real cause is bony enlargement or malpositioning of the toe there is a real simple surgert to smooth off the underlying bone and the corn should go away permanently you can also have your shoes stretched or wear wider shoes
3909,something that we md's should remember  is that any medical condition should always b ruled out b4 thinking psych all psychiatric diagnoses r diagnoses of elimination modern medicine can b 2 mechanical & specialized some mds wrongly assume depression or anxiety when they forget that our mind & body work together congrats 2 u 4 having found the right md who could diagnose & treat u accurately: good 4 u!
3910,could be strep throat and viral infections look and act similarly get a throat culture to know
3911,yes the breast tissue changes w age and hormonal changes if found on mammogram  densities require additional mammographic views  compression views and possibly ultrasound
3912,stones it is quite possible that known stones in the kidney are causing kidney pain this can occur through growth or shifting of a stone causing irritation or obstruction of the calyx in which it is located it may be time for eswl treatment talk to urologist about this
3913,check with your doc this could be nothing or the starting sign of something serious such as a heart or lung problem better be safe
3914,sinus you need to be evaluated for a sinus infection
3915,yes some breast tumors  even cancers  are slowly growing and may have formed a year or even two before it became large enough to bee seen it may be easier to understand this by knowing that a tumor the size of a small pea already has over a billion cells it
3916,check with md best to check with your physicians to determine whether this medication is safe to take at all if so  your plastic surgeon will guide you as to when to resume best wishes
3917,full excision glad you got that mole diagnosed you can almost certainly have it removed  perhaps with a skin ellipse or something even simpler this happens often & i wish you a speedy recovery
3918,yep! welcome to manhood! those little black hairs are the beginning! next  you'll see armpit hair  muscular development  voice changes  & everything else that changes a boy into a man - it may take a few years  but this is a great sign! the black genital hairs tell us that he is hormonally active & that his tissues are responsive to the coming changes! everything is on track just perfectly! party time!
3919,see below just because you have a +ana  you may not have any autoimmune processes that are causing problems scleroderma is rather uncommon  but it is autoimmune in nature a rheumatologist specializes in these types of disorders there are countless tests that can be done to determine  what  if any  autoimmune conditions you have and treatment can be started thereafter
3920,nerve irritation you may have lumbosacral nerve root irritation and the right hip replacement may or may not have anything to do with these new symptoms please have it evaluated by a family physician and a specialist inrehabilitation medicine
3921,rare  can happen unfortunately  recurrence of cancer can occur whether you have had a lumpectomy  mastectomy or nipple sparing mastectomy but only in a small number of patients your treating physicians will keep a close eye on you with regular checkups as we don't know your case history details including the type of reconstruction it would be best to speak with your oncologist  breast and reconstructive surgeon
3922,possibly unfortunately  i am not going to say unlikely  i have seen patients with sore nipples  itchy breasts  itchy rash on breasts  nipple discharge  tingling sensations in breast  --variations of the above  with / without pain-----go on to have breast cancer it may not be typical  but earliest detection is a must a neg mammogram and/or ultrasound does not mean you can't have ca see specialists bx
3923,er asap if your symptoms are paroxymal the consideration should include pheochromocytoma and toxicology

4196,mammograms are unable to diagnose cysts cysts are of the same x-ray density as solid soft tissue on mammo a cyst will look like a round mass on mammo  but ultrasound can usually easily distinguish cyst from solid cysts can come and go  and get bigger or smaller no way to predict what they will do fortunately  they are benign

4227,no  no sounds like your herpes simplex (get sex out of your mind) is rather easily treated are you real sensitive  emotional about dentists? emotions can trigger outbreaks not only have your dentist know  but your physician can stop all your ''ulcers'' with a tad of acyclovir and it is cheap and floss after every meal and before sleep

4231,no ; stop alcohol 400 mg of zoloft is twice the recommended maximum dose it is possible that you're getting an inadequate response due to alcohol in my experience  ssri medications do not work well in the presence of any alcohol if stopping all alcohol does not allow for a better response  then adding 2 mg of abilify might make a big difference
4232,yes  but why? i believe the argument that wisdom teeth causes crowding is a fallacy here is my analogy; let's say you have a tug of war  on one side you have 2 men  2 women 1 teenager and 2 kids on the other side you have 1 man start tugging who do you think will win it is 7 vs 1 mesial drift + mal alignment and some other fractors cause crowding  not the wisdom teeth good luck

4240,no it is not normal to be swollen in this case i am guessing you had a filling placed recently also you don't mention pain so i don't think of an infection and i am assuming the dentist fixed the high bite it is not uncommon to chew or bite your cheek post operatively while you are still numb this usually resolves on its own
4241,further testing your description suggests potential sensitivity to nerve compression  and raises question of possible peripheral neuropathy  even of small fibre origin cannot help confirm ms  as you could possess brain lesions of alternative cause you can sort all of this out with emg study  maybe skin punch biopsy  and even spinal fluid analysis discuss thee issues with your neurologist
4242,yes it sometimes can but it is not able to do so reliably the cancer has to be relatively large to be seen special ct colonography is performed at many centers for screening purposes my preference for colon cancer screening is colonoscopy as biopsy can be performed of any suspicious areas during the exam (not possible with ct colonography)

4520,shows demyelination recent revision of the diagnostic criteria for ms have increased the importance of mri findings the diagnosis of ms is made sooner in the course of the disease based upon the appropriate history physical findings and mri findings the mri abnormalities suggest demyelination in the brain/spinal cord if all other causes of demyelination are excluded  ms is the likely cause and treatment can begin
4521,see a doctor this is not a problem which can be approached on the internet you will have to be seen and examined  and perhaps tested for allergies
4522,yes jaundice can hang around at low levels for about a month as long as baby is gaining weight and eating well  we watch and wait if it is getting worse or persists another 1-2 weeks then you need to have the baby seen usually we just wait and all resolves with no long term problems
4523,time frame newly placed composites in teeth can cause the teeth to be sore for awhile if the pain persists  then i would get back to the dentist if the filling was deep  and near the nerve  there could be a potential nerve involvement also  if the filling is high in bite (you are hitting the area first before the other teeth ) the filling may need to be adjusted
4524,nortriptyline nortriptyline which is a tricyclic antidepressant has been shown to be helpful for depression in those with parkinson's disease also paroxetine has some evidence for treating depression in parkinson's in general antidepressants that work on norepinephrine and dopamine seem to help more antidepressants that affect serotonin can worsen movement symptoms common in pd such as restless legs
4525,repeat the prolactin if you were pregnant  it is unlikely that the high prolactin is due to a tumor have it repeated fasting  first thing in the morning before you get an mri the prolactin will go up with stress and a single test should be confirmed before going for an expensive test like an mri
4526,the same way your bones have healed the ligaments will heal the question is how will they heal we're they torn  did they get shredded and are they repairable on their own you would know if you still have pain or if the ankle is unstable if so you need to see the doc if the ligaments are so damaged there are ways a doc can stabilize the bones and find ways to recreate the job of the ligaments

4532,surgery as dr kass said   there are many surgeries with variables to them you can get the code from your surgeon and call your insurance company for an idea of the cost or your surgeon's office can call my office does that routinely for patients whether it be office or hospital based  pin or not - we can have a good idea of what we will be doing
4533,no fibroadenomas are benign and do not turn into cancer so you do not need them removed some will enlarge and they can cause pain  and some women simply dislike having a lump  so surgery is an option an alternative non-surgical option is cryoablation
4534,cigarettes ? i advise u not to smoke at all  it is well known that if smoking dies not cause lung cancer it can cause chronic bronchitis and copd
4535,no fibroadenomas are common  benign lesions along with cysts  these are the most common causes of a breast mass  particularly in younger women they aren't cancer  don't turn into cancer  and aren't associated with a high risk of eventually developing breast cancer surgical excision is an option  and sometimes recommended if they are getting bigger cryoablation is another option
4536,not necessarily the size of breast does not mean you need a mammogram- unless there is some reason  like family history or a lump felt by an experienced surgeon

4548,yes i have seen this a few times typically it is temporary and the symptoms can be resolved with steroids or even occasionally over-the-counter nsaid's such as ibuprofen the goal is to reduce swelling that may be compressing a nerve or some other structure in the area
4549,which tooth most commonly impacted tooth is wisdom tooth  and this problem is treated with oral surgery any other impacted tooth usually requires a combination of braces and localized surgery to make room for the impacted tooth  placement a handle on the tooth  and bringing the tooth into optimum alignment/function see a qualified orthodontic specialist for advice (initial exam usually free or low cost)
4550,radiculopathy! you are probably describing an s1nerve root compression  although a l5 is possible by your imprecise description pain is a paradoxical good sign  since pressure on the nerve is more minimal gravity traction may help  as might a steroid dose pack but if neither work  your next date will be a spine surgeon i always get an emg before imaging the spine
4551,likely panic attacks during a panic attacks  you are likely to experience symptoms similar to a heart attack--shortness of breath  pounding/rapid heart beat  sweating  dizziness  chest pain  nausea  and some even passes out this tends to get worse because every time it happens you get scared and worry about when the next one will come it is very treatable--many effective options please consult doc good luck
4552,may have instability one reason why you may not be getting better: presence of instability at l4-5 have you had standing xrays of the lower back? if not  then ask your md for standing xrays of lumbar spine including flexion (bending forward) and extension (bending backward) views many patients with instability feel shifting of the spine with bending + pain also changes with position: typically better when lie down

4557,generally  yes there are two types of heart failure  systolic and diastolic the echo alone is enough to exclude systolic failure and to make diastolic failure quite unlikely if the echo was done well and correctly interpreted the gold standard test for diastolic heart failure is a catheterization to measure heart pressures directly  but this may be overkill in your situation your md will advise
4558,nerve tumor neuromas are benign tumors which may arise spontaneously or as part of genetically determined processes trauma can trigger neuroma formation such is very common in women who often force their feet into ill-fitting shoes once formed  neuromas don't resolve gout may cause similar pain to the great toe see a podiatrist

4560,first of all congratulations on your survival and i know you stopped smoking if teh simple imaging of cxr and ct are negative  and you still cough  i would get pft's  including abg and dlco i'd see a pulmonary doctor and make sure a bronchoscopy was not indicated or a pet scan highly unlikely to be related to your old disease or treatment
4561,about a week probably in another week varies with patient
4562,eczema sounds like it may be dishidrotic eczema could be contact dermatitis from some exposure to chemicals or too frequent hand washing or it could be a fungal infection i would see your doctor in many cases avoidance  lotion/emollients  steroid cream and/or antifungals are needed it should be treatable though and can be a very troublesome condition

4570,wow - never had that question before but  that makes sense since i treated military working divers i frankly don't know any specifics time limit- but you had better not dive high diving should never be approached casually one must be physically ; mentally prepared for diving my recommendation is that you don't use cannabis unless you are being treated for a bonafide medical problem for which cannabis is indicated
4571,anti anxiety probably for something acute i would suggest acute like quicker acting anti anxiety agent like xanax or ativan if chronic or recurring would look at antidepressants like lexapro  paxil  prozac etc cymbalta can help and is indicated for generalized anxiety
4572,maybe 1  maybe none there is no correct dose for use of steroids for nerve root pain i prefer medrol dose pak but prednisone is ok expect at least 5 or 6 days of treatment to be needed--maybe 2 weeks steroids long term are very risky & are never first-line treatment of sciatica some people never respond to steroids
4573,nerve issue pinched nerve in neck is most likely cause of your symptoms pain often occurs first  followed by numbness don't be surprised by appearance of weakness so how long are you going to neglect this before you see a physician?

4580,not uncommon for a bad sprain  but wise to have it checked out nonetheless
4581,get it checked!!! get examined because several there are conditions such as a baker's cyst that can present themselves in the back of the knee and pinch a nerve to cause tingling in the toes you also have to rule out a more serious clot (dvt) examination and tests such as an ultrasound (doppler) would be used to diagnose
4582,mammo and ultrasound are complementary tests some abnormalities may be seen on one  but not the other so a suspicious mammo finding that cannot be seen on ultrasound is still a suspicious mammo finding  and likely needs biopsy
4583,no you're lucky to have no pain just sounds accept that excellent result
4584,follow your doctor's advice discuss with your doctor if he would do a needle aspirate first an a biopsy only if needed thyroid nodules are often multiple and removing the largest one may not address the issues see this site for more info http://wwwmayocliniccom/health/thyroid-nodules/ds00491/dsection=tests-and-diagnosis
4585,your symptoms are not consistent with the surgery you had in 2009 i suggest you consult with your pcp

4587,depends if there is a lump present then definitely yes in no mass and the pain is associated with your period  then most likely hormonakl
4588,possible  unlikely assuming well performed  well read by competent radiology specialists  it is unlikely that cancer would be missed could be other causes not seen with the above mentioned tests follow up with md
4589,unlikely severe headaches with systemic distress that can resolve with sleep are migraine they may totally disable you  but you recover to normal the next day tumors do not do that brain imaging needs to be done to be sure good health management is necessary discuss these issues with your doctor
4590,appropriate care complex case with several concerns needs careful evaluation and careful consideration of treatment then careful monitoring of benefit versus side effects of treatment need to focus on normal school performance  normal social performance  and good self esteem should have good outcome!
4591,possibly swelling after a surgical procedure is normal it usually is at its peak two days following a procedure if there is extensive bone removal when extracting the wisdom teeth  there is usually more swelling there are cases however  where minimal to no swelling occurs if the teeth are erupted and no bone removal is required this varies from person to person also
4592,strep throat if sore throat and fever are only symptoms you have  the chance of strep throat is high need to see your pcp

4598,time to see your doctor six weeks is a long time to have cough and you need to be evaluated please see your doctor consult this site for more information  but do not get caught up between 6 or 8 weeks; 6 weeks is long enough in a young person http://wwwmayocliniccom/health/chronic-cough/ds00957
4599,it depends if the damage is not too extensive  it may be possible to remineralize the tooth enamel this requires you see a dentist for a prescription of a fluoridated toothpaste which has a more concentrated form of fluoride in it that over the counter toothpastes also  the dentist can also do some in-office procedures which can remineralize the teeth deep cavities need fillings
4600,weight check babies typically can lose up to 10 % of their birth weight during the first week of life they then should gain wt daily your pediatrician can follow up with a weight check appointment in a few days to recheck his wt breast milk is the best formula for your son stools are typically yellow  mustard and seedy while breast feeding sometimes supplementing with a commercial formula is recommended
4601,just heal try to avoid medications you can ice your face to reduce the swelling good luck

4603,see womenshealthgov and radiologyinfo org under mammogram
4604,cephalexin this may not be a good antibiotic if the pustule is due to mrsa if you are not allergic to sulfa then bactrim or septra (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) may be a better choice
4605,unlikely may have tendonitis  bone prominence or bursitis best to have it evaluated may need xray for initial evaluation it not obvious  or if the doctor feels it may be soft tissue  then an mr can be helpful you should definitely have this evaluated dr l
4606,return to doctor possible referred pain from a tooth in lower arch  the lower arch has a branch of the trigeminal nerve that goes up the side of the jaw in front of the ear return to dentist to be revaluated
4607,neuropathy would be my initial diagnosissee your md to discuss
4608,expertise and cost the cons of having a general dentist perform wisdom tooth extractions is generally expertise oral surgeons spend years in training to specialize in this type of thing furthermore  they can often manage complications better the benefit is that your general dentist is probably less expensive this is not to say that your general dentist couldn't do a fine job! talk to him or her about it !
4609,don't write it off you should be examined the infraorbital nerve  which gives sensation to the cheek runs through the floor of the eye socket orbital (eye socket) or maxillary sinus infections and other processes can give you the triad of symptoms you are relating don't panic  but do see a doctor if you are concerned i'd recommend an oculoplastic surgeon  or an ophthalmologist at the very least

4612,immediately the cpm machine was designed to get the knee moving after surgery while studies have not shown any long term difference in total knee patients with or without the use of cpm  it can be used after surgery and may help some patients with preoperative stiffness in the knee it is not absolutely required after tka
4613,no this is not a known risk factor for oral cancer
4614,bv anyway? trich? bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of strong vaginal odor  especially if it smells fishy bv is overgrowth of mostly normal vaginal bacteria trichomonas  an std  causes similar odor bv can be hard to diagnose  and trich is often missed by the most common test  exam of fluid by microscope ask your doc about rechecking for bv and perhaps the newer  much more senstive dna test for trich
4615,headache headache would more likely be the cause than the sinus infection if the symptoms have lasted for several days now you should get checked out
4616,see a dentist first see a dentist to possibly have the tooth removed pain from a wisdom tooth can radiate to the ear
4617,yes usually you can see tumors that have spread to the lungs on an x-ray however  you can have stage 4 cancer without there being any cancer in the lungs i had a patient once who had stage 4 kidney cancer and her lungs were totally fine
4618,see a doctor you need to see a regular doctor to confirm the diagnosis and to start oral antibiotics
4619,yes neurological consult would be your next step closed head injuries are difficult to diagnose
4620,ask your doctor if you blood pressure is under good control on medication  then the risk will be small any time you have pain (like after surgery)  blood pressure will typically go up  even in very healthy individuals you should see your family doctor or internist for a preoperative assessment before your surgery for optimal safety
4621,many possibilities some causes of swelling of the extremities can include systemic problems such as hypertension  gout  and problems with the kidneys and localized issues such as arthritis  infection  lymphatic obstruction  blood clots  varicose veins  trauma (fracture  sprain  and tendonitis) and side effects to medication have it evaluated by a professional and get the appropriate treatment
4622,yes but your blood pressure needs to be well controlled to minimize your risk of complications during and after your surgery
4623,get workup the most concerning is the narrow stools and blood this could be rectal cancer you need a colonoscopy
4624,i've i've never heard of mesotherapy for acne scars and wrinkles it is usually used for fat reduction and its effectiveness is not proven as a rule  the old adage no pain  no gain applies to cosmetic surgery as well as to exercise botox and fillers are great and relatively low risk but acne scars may require something more aggressive than a simple injection hope that helps
4625,you you should have a ct scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a good look at the liver and spleen also make sure you get a cbc  if your white count is elevated then the lymph node should be investigated lastly  since you are a smoker and have had such a significant weight loss  a cxr is also a good idea best of luck
4626,this this does sound like possibly atopic dermatitis  which is common form of eczema seen in children i would consider using cerave hydrating cleanser (gentle  soapless cleanser)  cerave cream to moisturize the skin everyday  and a possible trip to the dermatologist for good treatment options for my patients  i often combine the above therapy with prescriptions such as protopic ointment  desonide ointment  or cutivate ointment with pretty good success i hope that helps! take a look at the link below for a picture of eczema that probably is similar to what you are talking about
4627,possible neuropathy depending on the affected nerves  symptoms of diabetic neuropathy can range from a numbness and tingling sensation  possibly a burning sensation  to an uncomfortable painful sensation of the extremities neuropathy may affect your digestive system  urinary tract  blood vessels and the heart for some people  the symptoms are mild; for others  it can be painful and disabling

4629,not so bad if a wisdon tooth that is a bony impaction needs to be extracted  it is usually just a thin layer of bone that needs to be removed to access the tooth a surgeon does these types of extractions routinely  and the post operative discomfort is minimized if you closely follow the instructions given by the oral surgeon normal recovery should be just a few days
4630,lexapro lexapro is isomers of celexa  with fewer side effects and better tolerability
4631,no mammograms are only one tool to detect breast cancers lobular breast cancers  which make up 15% of breast cancers  and inflammatory breast cancers are often not seen on mammogram i tell patients there are three parts to detecting breast cancer: 1 self-exam monthly 2 breast exam by healthcare professional yearly  and 3 mammogram yearly after age 40
4632,surgery stage i/ii surgery is the standard of care for early stage lung cancer (either stage i and ii) not only does surgery remove the entire tumor  but accurately determines the stage by removing the associated lymph nodes  and allows the pathologist to examine them although radiation has shown to be effective in patients who can't undergo surgery  there is little long term (> 5 years) data see: cancergov
4633,gums or nerves could be gum pain or a tooth nerve gone bad only your dentist can tell you you need an x-ray and a nerve test
4634,see neurologist your history is too nonspecific to confirm ms  but one white matter lesion may be a clue repeat mri in 6 months if your problems continue  new lesions  especially gadolinium positive  could confirm ms if you lack confidence in current physician  get a second opinion
4635,yes radiation is used in curing lung cancer its used in varying combinations with surger and chemotherapy to find the best treatment for each stage and type of lung cancer it is not used in every case of lung cancer to accomplish the desired effect stage one for example requires no radiation and would not help the survival if the patient has surgery with lobectomy
4636,absolutely absolutely this could be a middle or inner ear issue see your local ent asap
4637,yikes  yikes  no replacing your dental silver filings will release more mercury into your system in one dental visit then a lifetime of chewing on them evidence-based dentistry has time after time confirmed that mercury-amalgam fillings are safe except in rare instances of allergy there are several situations where we recommend replacing silver filings but concerns over mercury blood levels is not one of them please reference the american dental association (http://wwwadaorg/3094aspx)
4638,ada a great dentist is someone with a passion and drive towards always being at their best! the place to start is to make sure your dentist is an active member of the american dental association! the typical ada member is committed to excellence and always puts patients first! here i am with the current ada president at a national conference this past april i'd make a referral for u  but privately!
4639,unusual that would be quite unusual but he made need prednisone check with lung specialist and get cxr
4640,first first of all i would like you to understand that any clicking from your tmj (temporo mandibular joint) is a desrrangement of your joint  the sound you hear is the little cushion or what we call the disc of the joint being crashed and sometimes displaced during your opening and closing motions at times is painful  causing face pain  ringing in the ear  headaches  migraines  neck pain  upper back pain  symptoms can go on for months  years  even some people can live with these conditions some others can't  and seek professional help tmd(temporo madibular disfunction) is mostly related to collapsing of the bite hight  stress or accidents treatments can be safely be treated in most instances without surgery  with an orthopedic repositioning appliance(ora either for daytime or nighttime) that will relieve the pressure to the disc and to the nerve bundle of the area the treatment can be more complex  i'm just trying to give you a brief in understanding your clicking  but if you don't have any symptoms  and the clic is not related to an accident there is no reason to be be worry good luck!
4641,hello hello i cannot diagnose your condition however  with history of difficulty swallowing  swollen lymph nodes and generalized malaise  it would be prudent to get seen so that you can get a strepth test your medical provider may need to investigate more if those nodes don't start going down in size
4642,your your description of your symptoms of right sided pain that goes into the back  gas and belching  sounds very much like the symptoms many people describe from their gallstones the symptoms are usually made worse after eating  especially if fatty or fried foods once symptoms develop  often people note that the frequency of their ill feeling may increase  or happen more often there is probably little benefit to wait to get more illness or have episodes of vomiting an ultrasound is usually sufficient unless there are some unusual problems that you are having that would require a ct scan your doctor or surgeon can discuss with you the best tests for your specific conditions laparoscopic surgery for gallbladder removal is often an outpatient surgery that one can recover from fairly quickly  in 2 weeks or less
4643,yes - needle biopsy nodules above 1 cm should be biopsied as well as smaller nodules with suspicious features  e g calcifications on ultrasound a fine needle aspration (fna) can be performed to provide information about the nodule without removing it while fna is not 100% accurate  it certainly can provide enough information to guide you and you physician in the right direction

4645,viral? if it is a primary herpetic stomatitis or flu  which can be very uncomfortable  amoxicillin will be of no use (unless to treat a secondary bacterial infection) if viral  treat symptoms  it will abate  but stay hydrated! if it is indeed bacterial (bacterial infections tend to have higher fevers) then perhaps a culture and sensitivity test for a specific antibiotic would be wise good luck!

4648,bonded composite is a far better filling material than amalgam (mercury) fillings for several reasons 1) amalgam expands and contracts at a far greater rate than tooth structure when having hot or cold foods  this difference causes chipped  cracked teeth and recurrent decay 2) greater tooth reduction needed when placing amalgam  retention grooves cut into healthy tooth= weaker tooth 3) toxic mercury in amalgam

4658,the the word should  should almost be banned from the language it seems as if you have an endodontic problem i am sure your dentist expected this to work however  expectations are not always realized since it has not gotten better a different treatment must be tried it seems as if the infection is beating the antibiotics  and something else has to be done to eliminate the infection the abscess has to be drained or a root canal has to be started

5325,lose weight you need to lose weight  all your tests indicated that your heart in good condition when you gained weight the fat inside your stomach need more room so it will push the lung via the diaphragme  and reduced the air volume in the lung that why you feel you are out of breath see a diet specialist nutrionist and follow a diet and exercise and you will see a difference

5328,it may pain in a tooth can certainly be due to infection you need to see the dr and get examined to find out why the tooth is aching you so best wishes
5329,yes not a bad idea  especially if you have fever i would want them to rule out strep throat could just be viral  but better to be checked

5331,pretty unlikely if this was not consensual  it is molestation sexual abuse and you need to go to the police otherwise  unless she had a cut on her finger that was open  the chances are practically zero (there are no sure things in medicine) even with an open bleeding cut  one time contact is often not enough to contract hiv
5332,metformin 6 weeks could be long enough to consider a change in dose it depends on what is your goal for treatment i am not clear if you are treating the insulin resistance  in which case your doctor is probably checking hemoglobin a1c every 3 months  or if you are trying to improve fertility in pcos most doctors prefer to increase slowly to minimize gi upset
5333,yes ok sometimes unsolicited gifts like std may pop up be aware of the by product of sexual activity; the other one is pregnancy
5334,indeed i would see your doctor for a full evaluation to make sure though typical symptoms include numbness and/or tingling of the thumb and index/middle fingers  aching wrist  and clumsiness try a wrist splint overnight to alleviate those symptoms until you see your doctor hope you feel better!
5335,depends on other symptoms  and exposure to std's from your partner(s)  and whether or not you have been tested for any of them already also if there's any accompanying chills or fever it does not necessarily by itself mean that it is an std so call your gyn  and have it examined in person that will alleviate any worry
5336,see doc! you don't say if you have a sore throat or not regardles s if this is new  you need to get seen this could be strep throat and you need to be treated with antibiotics to avoid the chance of getting rheumatic fever also  strep throat goes away without antibiotics  but treatment is essential within about 10 days of onset of illness  so that rheumatic fever does not develop
5337,maybe gingivitis the gums behind the last molars can get inflamed  called gingivitis that area is harder to keep clean with brushing and flossing  so gingivitis happens more often a dental cleaning can help meanwhile  brushing vigorously to clean out that area  and then being very gentle with that area for a week  may let it heal up if discomfort remains  a dentist can check if it is something bad like cancer
5338,may be beneficial bone grafts can be beneficial if an implant is to placed the grafts act as a scaffold  resorb and ultimately are replaced by your own bone or form a bridge with your bone if an implant is not planned it will be beneficial to place a graft which isn't resorbed  one in which will remain for an extended period and support the adjacent native bone  providing a better esthetic  functional prosthesis
5339,do something restful be sure to sit upright - this enables gravity to help your acid reflux symptoms give the tums time to work do something restful  whether meditating  a relaxing music piece or a reading is this a unique event for you or something that has been repeating for some time hope that helps  and let us know how you are doing
5340,pharyngitis a sore throat is much more likely to be just that viral pharyngitis is most likely particularly if there is redness of lining of the back inside the throat that painful gland is a regional lymph node it's full of immune cells fighting the infection if you have fever  open sores or white (pus covered) tonsils then get checked out for strep throat cancer is more common in older smokers
5341,possibly many times the looseness is from the infection if this the case it may firm up after the treatment have the tooth evaluated by an endodontist prior to treatment to get the best opinion
5342,salivary nodes these bumps may be swollen salivary glands that can get blocked by calcium deposits and then become infected easily treated with augmentin  but if infection returns i would seek attention from an ent to see if the salivary duct is blocked if this a lymph node infection  a biopsy is might be needed to determine the source of infection
5343,medical visit any persistent/worsening neurologic symptoms should be evaluated at a face to face medical visit
5344,need mamogram/ultra this can be a number of things breast pain is not a common presenting symptom of breast cancer  but can occur breast pain during menses is common due to enlargement of the breast ducts during the estrogen surge i would have a mammogram or ultrasound if you have a painful lump  although this is usually due to fibrocystic disease
5345,migraine equivalent migraine symptoms can last for few days  but symptoms lasting for 2 wks little unusual for the migraine  have it checked out it could be a sign of neuropathy
5346,see below you need an ankle brace to correct the foot drop see ortho for the ankle brace
5347,location different if there is increased pressure in veins then they become larger and prominent varicose veins in the legs enlarge because they have a leaky valve and gravity tends to pull the blood back down causing the veins to enlarge hemorrhoids are veins in the anus that enlarge due to pressure from constipation and straining
5348,red blood cells hemoglobin and hematocrit refer to the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood the remaining results describe the size of red cells and their hemoglobin content and variations in size as dr ho pointed out  it is for your doctor to read these details and advise you
5349,not necessarily it sounds like you may have injured the elbow again it is worth having it evaluated to see what the bones  joint and ligaments look like now reserve your concern until you know what's happening some injuries don't show up on imaging when they first occur
5350,yes swelling at that joint could be consistent with arthritis  infection  or be related to trauma this does require additional medical attention
5351,yes allergy testing is one way to find out but i found allergy testing to be cumbersome and expensive  best way will be to talk to a good internist
5352,our filters lymph nodes are our filters to take organisms (bacteria  viruses  etc) out of our bloodstream most common reason for a swollen lymph node is infection especially if it is sore and swollen  it is more likely to be secondary to infection or inflammation (it can also swell in association with allergies)
5353,yes cirrhosis is one of the most common causes of liver cancer
5354,c ur doctor there are many different things that can cause lumps in the armpit that are not cancerous you need to see a doctor for a formal exam they can determine the next best step (reassurance  biopsy  ultrasound  mammogram) good luck!
5355,someone is mis-informed: er  pr  her-2-neu all negative is triple negative; you report you are dually positive with 2 receptors have your medical oncologist check and re-explain this 2 u you hae every reason to be quite optimistic  but your med onc has more factsthan i do best wishes
5356,see your doc could be gallstones but could also be other problems too please talk with your doctor about what will help you the most
5357,need to know er/pr receptor status on resected tumor  as if these are negative  no role for hormone therapy post orpre-menopausal er+ patients are treated with the effective  cheap  low adverse effect tamoxifen  a useful drug for more than 30 years but ovarain function precluses use of anastrazome or the newer more expensive letrozole these all work; toxiicty and cost vary
5358,yes but both can cause mild sedation so be careful
5359,panic possibly attenuated form of panic attack not sure if u r on medications but consult your doctor if reoccurs
5360,maybe it depends on your symptoms and the location of the meniscal tear some small tears located in the vascular areas of the meniscus may heal  while others usually do not but if symptoms are severe or interfere with activities of daily living  then surgery is the best choice
5361,breast lumps that have no correlate on mammogram or ultrasound are typically normal breast tissue that feels lumpy
5362,antihistamine try claritin  allegra  zyrtec or benadryl be aware the last will make you sleepy  do only use it at night if that fails nasalcrom spray if no luck see your doctor for nasal steroid spray prescription
5363,many do pediatricians see many kids with bm difficulties and are very knowledgeable with management of perianal problems they will make the appropriate referral to gi or surgery if specialty input is needed

5371,possibly position of intercourse is not likely to matter  however the position the woman assumes immed after might if uterus is tilted  lying flat may be detrimental try assume position on side or elevate hips with pillow 4 20-30 min at least
5372,diagnostic guess amongst other things i might be most concerned with is crps- chronuc regional pain syndrome you should head to your physician and get further evaluation  the statement of hypersensitivty to touch is what separates crps from other pain syndromes
5373,suspicious only imaging techniques other than an mri may be an indication of the level of suspicion for malignancy in the context of several other findings on history and physical examination however  a diagnosis ultimately requires a biopsy
5374,repeat the prolactin if you were pregnant  it is unlikely that the high prolactin is due to a tumor have it repeated fasting  first thing in the morning before you get an mri the prolactin will go up with stress and a single test should be confirmed before going for an expensive test like an mri
5375,raynauds this can be a number of things raynauds  allergy to your winter shoes  neuro dermatitis i suggest you get evaluated
5376,shin splints best to support arch with orthotic ice after walking helps try to walk on a flat surface avoid hills

5380,yes a directed ultrasound of the breast should be done to check the affected breast  as well as a careful physical exam if these tests are normal  it may be advisable to order an mri of the breast
5381,metastatic cancer breast cancer can spread to the lungs  but we still consider it breast cancer (we call it metastatic then) other than that i don't know of a link with breast cancer and lung cancer (cancer that arose from the lung tissue)
5382,depends this depends on the tumor characteristics best to discuss this your friendly oncologist
5383,it's likely that you have dense breasts  which in itself may be a br ca risk they are chasing a suspicious finding usually the u/s gives sufficient imaging to nable a biopsy  and only that proves that you do or do not have cancer mr is indicated in dense breasts it sees where mammo is blind  but it finds things that do not prove to be cancer in all instances you do not have ca until they prove it
5384,maybe although a contrast-enhanced ct--or  better still  a pelvic ultrasound--are preferred methods for visualizing the ovaries  a non-contact ct would likely show nonspecific irregularities of the ovaries bottom line: pelvic ultrasound is the best choice for visualizing ovaries
5385,yes get a pregnancy test and that should tell you
5386,unclear the data on this is unclear stress has a negative effect on many systems in the body
5387,4 weeks it may take 14 days for soft tissue to attach and 28 days for them to cross link (providing strength) normally if you don't have agraft (usually you don't need them) you can eat right away since the wisdom teeth is located far back and not involve with occlusion (it may hurt upon swallowing due to swelling 2-3 days) since you have a graft  chew on the other side so the graft can be protected
5388,depends periodontist and oral surgeons can perform these procedures i have performed these procedures from as quick as 10 min to as long as 30 min it really depends if the patient is a compliant patient and there are no other health issue that may complicate the surgery
5389,possible break this could be a stress fracture to the heel or ankle bone you need to get an xray from your podiatrist to determine if this is the reason other causes are tendonitis to the area  bursitis of the achilles tendon to name a few if you are a serious runner  than you need to have a good sports podiatrist that can help you with this and get you back running quickly
5390,talk 2 ur oncologist findings on chest x-rays may be suspicious  but rarely diagnostic important considerations include comparison to prior chest x-ray and your clinical history i anticipate that you will need a ct of the chest for more definitive evaluation while it is normal human nature to assume the worst  try not to get too far ahead of yourself good luck-i hope it's a false alarm
5391,most likely  not degenerative disc disease is a form of arthritis involving the articulations of the spine as the disease progresses  the articulations become more and more dysfunctional many times the disease is self limiting and can be managed medically sometimes the articulations have to be stabilized surgically
5392,stimulate healing i have documented repeately that man  horses and dogs can heal joint problems if the connective tissue and a stimulus to cause healing is taken by mouth  msm(methyl sulfoxyl methane) taken in the dose 3000mg 2to3 doses per day the lack of healing may be reversed by using high grade chicken collagen or a condition where the cartilage has been totally destroyed  then only joint replacement
5393,infection you have a gum infection that is recurring  that is the gum over your wisdom tooth traps debris and becomes irritated and infected most likely  you will need the wisdom tooth extracted
5394,keep your leg elevated as well as much as possible this is not uncommon how long it will last may also depend on what type of surgery you had which you did not specify
5395,rebound congestion from your post i'm wondering if the congestion is from allergies / cold or from overuse of 4way nasal spray as little as 3 consecutive days of use can produce rebound congestion that said  4way is difficult to find but there are other products with phenylephrine (neo-synephrine) i would recommend giving yourself a break and using saline and breath right strips good luck!

5402,no superficial leg clots  or svts  are an annoyance but do not travel to the deep vein system to cause a dvt treatment is with an antiinflammatory like advil or aleve  walking  and use of graduated compression stockings if you have frequent svts  you should have a vein evaluation and sometimes a blood-clotting disorder workup which involves blood tests as well as evaluating recent medications
5403,yes  if disabled yes  if disabled
5404,one tab 4-6 hrs tapentadol is used to treat moderate to severe pain that is expected to last for a short time tapentadol is in a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics normally one tablet every 4-6 hours is sufficient however  your doctor may tell you to take another tablet one hour after your first dose for severe pain
5405,very possible sinus infections can cause the upper teeth to hurt  especially the back ones combined with your other symptoms i would think you have a rather bad cold combined with a sinus infection i would visit your doctor asap for an evaluation
5406,3 months it takes about 6 weeks to feel better than you did before surgery when walking and 3 months to return to all normal activities i tell patients that it will be a year before you reach maximal improvement
5407,read below this could be due to a vitamin deficiency  fibromyalgia  reaction to a medication or food to name a few a thorough blood work up and exam will give you more specifics as to what the problem is
5408,ask for pain pill i assume your doctor is suspecting something  since you will have mammogram in 2 days  just take some pain medications for few days until they know whats causing the pain if the lump is large   you better schedule a biopsy after discussing with your doctorin your case i would prefer a sonogram
5409,second opinion ask to see another dentist for a second opinion if he hasn't referred you yet nothing wrong with a second set of eyes i'm never offended if a patient asks for a second opinion
5410,wait a little longer this could simply be a little premenstrual bleeding  but it is really too early to be certain that you are not pregnant taking the pregnancy tests so early is not very helpful because the pregnancy hormones don't start to become detectable until about 8 days post conception  and the miscarriage rate then is very high
5411,dvt? get evaluated asap as this maybe a dvt  if you have had one you are at significantly higher risk for another
5412,not likely it is remotely possible that the baby will get a herpes infection but very unlikely
5413,first of all congratulations on your survival and i know you stopped smoking if teh simple imaging of cxr and ct are negative  and you still cough  i would get pft's  including abg and dlco i'd see a pulmonary doctor and make sure a bronchoscopy was not indicated or a pet scan highly unlikely to be related to your old disease or treatment
5414,you need to be exam tonsils are usually not black you should be seen by an otolaryngologist

5416,can't tell based on limited information  but if you look at the bottom of the report  there will be a birads category for the lesion  which is the radiologist's level of suspicion birads 2 is benign  3 is probably benign(less than 2% chance of cancer)  4 is suspicious(about 30%)  and 5 is highly suspicious(about 75% or more)
5417,ae these peristent? check for gonorrhea and chlamydia if asymptomatic  leave alone  recheck in a few weeks/months
5418,yes i do not restict my patients from sleeping on their side after knee replacement surgery

5422,not always no but during any infection or allergies you can feel congested
5423,ankle fracture you have not provided enough information to justify such a drastic procedure there are ankle implants or ankle fusions that generally can resolve chronic joint pain post trauma
5424,see your surgeon this may be normal scar tissue ormay be an indication that more therapy is recommended your surgeon will surely want to know about this
5425,most likely surgery can try injection of steroid first
5426,spine surgeon given the nature of your spine surgery  and the fact that your neck may need to be “extended” for anesthesia purposes during breast surgery  best to wait for “clearance” from your spine surgeon be patient and do not risk disruption of any cervical spine work that was done best wishes
5427,no there is no evidence that vitamin e oil does anything to improve any of those things and may in fact make matters worse in terms of your acne by blocking the pores there are so many great treatments available for your problem  please do yourself a favor and seek out a reputable plastic surgeon with an interest in skin care or a dermatologis
5428,depends you should see your doctor there is no way to tell what is going on without a physical exam and a thorough history could be as simple as a yeast infection or something more complex

5430,diplopia diplopia episodes can be a sign of something serious although the differential diagnosis is extensive the causes you have listed are not the most common causes but all need to be ruled out by an eye doctor
5431,stop smoking you doctor tested you and it is good news you don't have cancer  don't smoke and if continue   news will not be good next time

5433,it may have moved the fracture may have moved after having seen the first doctor if it does not need surgery  follow their guidance on how to prevent further displacement
5434,not sure peripheral neuropathy can be from many things it may not show up on a blood test see a neurologist and ask questions
5435,rejection of graft wisdom teeth extraction is a subtractive procedure  i e  we removed the tooth bone grafting is a additive procedure  where we introduce new material into our body thus in the later procedure  our body will either reject or accept the new graft the ultimate cause would be infection
5436,not related not related
5437,possible the most common cause of optic neuritis is ms  and the other symptoms would fit see a neurologist and get an answer  and get treated for your underlying cause
5438,get it checked!!! get examined because several there are conditions such as a baker's cyst that can present themselves in the back of the knee and pinch a nerve to cause tingling in the toes you also have to rule out a more serious clot (dvt) examination and tests such as an ultrasound (doppler) would be used to diagnose
5439,viral illness everything you've described could all be caused by a viral illness are you around children? or other folks who have been sick or  perhaps  stayed home from school or work now? if you're not improving in a day or so  you should seek attention for a possibly more serious infection
5440,you may need to have an x-ray or mri to see if you have a fracture or ligament tear ankle sprains can take 8 to 10 weeks to heal on average
5441,lymph nodes please see a head and neck surgeon soon
5442,better to be safe get it checked out immediately
5443,first  pain due to a cancer tends to be more prevalent at night and is constant  not just when you are awake tests are good but a clinical evaluation done well is the best way to help diagnose a problem followed by indicated testing sounds like it is not cancer based but you should get a diagnosis of what your problem is
5444,possible any lump in the breast   in adult the first thing is to rule out is cancer must have examination mammogram ( & sono if needed ) and biopsy to prove other wise   will not have any symptoms in early stages  please see your doctor
5445,yes there are no issues with remaining on birth control and having breast implant surgery some surgeons prescribe antibiotics after the surgery antibiotics may reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills therefore  it may be necessary to take additional precautions for a month
5446,possible you need to be seen by your oncologist  you may need bone scan and biopsy to determine if its a recurrence or metastatic lesion
5447,unlikely severe headaches with systemic distress that can resolve with sleep are migraine they may totally disable you  but you recover to normal the next day tumors do not do that brain imaging needs to be done to be sure good health management is necessary discuss these issues with your doctor
5448,maybe a ct scan can show possible concerning findings based on a radiologist's interpretation of what is seen often these findings indicate a need for further testing first  such as pet scan or biopsy see hour oncologist to identify if the ct scan findings are genuinely concerning first
5449,viral this could be viral infection  i e ebv  flu  cmv  adenovirus  rhinovirus or assoicated secondary bacterial infection need to see your doctor and needs testing and appropriate testing
5450,see a podiatrist you need to see a podiatrist to establish the problem the numbness could be related to the swelling

5452,fever & cough fever caused by viral infections can last 3-7 days appetite decreases with any infection; that will return when the infection resolves in the condition he is in now  i would recommend watchful observation if he becomes lethargic  irritable or if the cough worsens and he stops eating or drinking  have him checked by his pediatrician
5453,it depends each person with breast cancer is differen age  physical + mental ability  preference for treatment  cancer stage and other characteristics all play a role in deciding on treatment chemotherapy is not always required natural treatments to decrease the risk of a recurrence would include smoking cessation  limited alcohol consumption  a healthy diet  and maintaining a weight in the normal range
5454,yes the gums don't seal to the outer surface of the tooth this can allow bacteria and food to enter over time  a cavity can develop
5455,maybe depends on how long after surgery and how bad your nerve was damaged before the surgery by the pressure on it many surgeons give local anesthetics so it maybe numb for several days from the local if your nerve was severely damaged prior to the surgery  it will take longer to recover and tingling is often a sign of the nerve recovering this may last for up to a year
5456,you need a sports medicine specialist to treat you you need an mri to evaluate damage
5457,get your doc to eval you should not have numbness as a result of a scaphoid fracture did you have surgery or is the splint/cast on too tight? could be early carpal tunnel syndrome as a result of the swelling from the fracture
5458,strong there is a direct link we still use hrt and it is also related to the duration of use hope this helps here is a link to a synopsis of a study published in the lancet http://wwwmillionwomenstudyorg/publications/27/breast-cancer-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-the-million-women-study/

5463,seek help go back to the dentist who did the extraction if that doesn't help  go to another dentist
5464,rotoscoliosis you may have rotoscoliosis -- an abnormal bend in your backbone causing chest and truncal stress and strain and pain -- if this is so  you need to do the best you can but you would need to take ibuprofen for pain as needed -- exercise and keeping your weight down will help
5465,auto immune disease these can be a sign of autoimmune disease and you should see your family doctor first for a work-up
5466,tylenol one of the major problems with long term use of any hydrocodone preparation in the us is that hydrocodone is not available without varying doses of apap  or tylenol why this is the case is anyones guess oxycodone is available plain  as are many other opiod analgesics my concern with continued vicodin  anexia  lortab  usage is cumulative liver damage from the acetaminophen

5473,headache headache would more likely be the cause than the sinus infection if the symptoms have lasted for several days now you should get checked out

5750,meniscus tears meniscus tears generally do not heal due to the fact that they have very poor blood supply they may become less symptomatic with time generally surgery is more reliable to treat meniscus tears with partial removal of the torn tissue repairs are possible but less common
5751,wait depending on how long ago that molar was extracted  it could be normal from the socket healing specially if it was a traumatic (difficult) extraction but if you still in pain a week to 10 days down the road with no signs of infection or dry socket  then you probably need to seek a second opinion to make sure no damage happened to surrounding structure around the extraction site or other reasons
5752,see a dentist asap if swollen  could be serious infection if you aren't on antibiotics you may need to be don't wait any longer!
5753,yes ankle sprains are caused by rolling the ankle there are three ligaments on the outside of the ankle the degree of the injury is graded based upon the ligaments damaged its important to have the stability evaluated as an athlete  you don't want to have it checked and rehab and brace it quickly in the meantime  rice (rest  ice compression  elevation) is your best bet until you see the dr

5763,torn medial meniscus will require surgery  see orthopedic surgeon
5764,smoking b4 trtment smoking decreases the ability of the soft tissues of the mouth to heal introducing a strong irritant such as cigarette smoke just prior to tooth extraction is ill advised

5770,sinus communication hopefully and oral surgeon performed the procedure and will see you for follow-up sounds like you may have had a maxillary sinus perforation/communication you should be on antibiotics  ie ceftin  a decongestant  ie clariten-d  and avoid blowing your nose  spitting  or drinking through straw for the next 21 days these usually heal uneventfully  but sometimes require surgery for closure
5771,glad you asked the diagnosis can be made on history and physical exam and your prior mri's should help confirm the diagnosis if appropriate patterns exist on occasion  spinal fluid analysis is used in ambiguous cases you really do need an experienced sub-specialized neurologist  perhaps even one who works at a teaching hospital if you have ms  you need a potent medication  but key is confirmed diagnosis
5772,alveolar osteitis even though alveolar osteitis is a rare situation when placing bone graft after surgical extraction   but sometimes it happened especially if the bone placed is synthetic bone  you are giving the symptoms of a dry socket please get evaluated by an oral surgeon may be removing the graft and establishing a new clot will helpyou have been taking antibiotics for so long and it is not working
5773,probably not  but  this is probably gynecomastia  a little bit of breast development from teen hormones being a teen is difficult enough without this have your physician take a look; removing it is a simple procedure

5779,first thing to get is an x-ray to make sure there is no fracture rest  ice  compression and elevation will help if hurts when bending the joint get it checked to make sure there is no complete rupture of ligaments
5780,not a good idea follow the postoperative instructions you were given chewing gum and mints can disrupt the healing process wait at least a week to new gum no rinsing for a few days after the extraction call your extracting dentist with any questions or concerns they will be eat able to help youp

5783,yes could be infected  scratched  or could have caused food impaction probably better to clean between your teeth with floss or a water pik see your dentist to have area checked and treated ask for his/her best hygiene recommendations for you
5784,read more about it to learn more about imaging and radiation  see: http://www conciergeradiologistcom/ct-scan-radiationhtml and http://wwwconciergeradiologistcom/radiation-exposurehtml properly indicated imaging studies represent  by definition  situations where the risks of radiation exposure are outweighed by the benefits to the patient i wouldn't worry about ct scan radiation causing a brain tumor
5785,yes of the various methods of detecting breast cancer(exam  mammo  us  mri)  clinical exam is the least sensitive for detecting breast cancer  and mri the most sensitive this stands to reason because clinical exam can only detect cancers that have become large enough to palpate  while imaging modalities can potentially detect tiny cancers before they have grown palpable
5786,ibs there are many illnesses that mimic ibs  so make sure this is what you have but for cramping from ibs then antispasmotics do help medications such as bentyl or levabid help the spasms associated with ibs regular bowel movements also help use metamucil
5787,infection feverishness & loose stools suggest an infectious process viral infections are usually self-limiting (few days) while bacterial infections can escalate to severe illness  vomiting  significant feverishness & dehydration; oft requiring doctor assistance blood in stool worrisome irritable bowel syndrome is functional disorder without known cause  absent fever  & is chronic (months to years)

5789,see below hard to say get seen for a physical exam there may be anything from a muscle  tendon  ligament strain  baker's cyst  or other issues related to tissue around the knee but a dvt must always be considered and your doc  with an exam can help to figure if dvt testing is needed
5790,tmj after surgery tmj pain or soreness are very common and may occur after the removal of complicated impacted wisdom teeth see your surgeon for evaluation and treatment options

5792,unlikely usually well tolerated  but checking inr is not a big deal
5793,more information if you are college age  the best thing is salt gargles  but i use 1 tablespoon in 6 oz of warm water  to gargle and spit out antibiotics do help get rid of strep more quickly  but won't help you feel better sooner  and most sore throats are viral  so no antibiotic will help if you are in grade school  which i doubt  you should be seen  as the risk of complications from strep are greater

5799,poss but not prob some more information would be useful for instance  if you have lesions involving the spinal cord then multiple sclerosis remains the most likely diagnosis while it is possible to have other autoimmune disorders such as lupus or sjogren's these are statistically less likely and would present with other symptoms/signs ie rash  joint involvement  dry eyes  dry mouth i hope this helps
5800,cubital tunnel syndr avoidance of movements & positions that provoke symptoms  particularly minimizing activities that place the elbow in a flexed position (driving  using the phone  etc )  including during sleep with use of a properly wrapped towel pt  meds such as nsaids  tca's  anticonvulsants +/- injection orthopedic surgeon for decompressive > transposition surgery if advanced or conservative treatment failed

5804,possible with first day of period june 21  you would have ovulated about july 5  so the 4th was your best day and the 2nd was close the brown spotting could be from intercourse and old blood from your cervix or bleeding from ovulation if you conceived  the embyo would be just now implanting or in the next couple of days you will know in 2 weeks if you are pregnant but it is possible
5805,muscles the peroneal (fibular) muscles are located on the lateral (side of the leg for the little toe) portion  there is a long one (longus) and a short on (brevis) while damage to the muscle is rare  depending on the type of pain and duration  aggravations (ie walking)  it may be due to blood supply to the muscle or aggravation of a tendon (attaches muscle to bone) an examination is needed
5806,total colectomy given the history of uc and now the changes to colon cancer  you need to have the entire colon removed there is a possibility that you could still have a j-pouch and keep fecal continence  without the need for a permanent ileostomy  but this would have to be assessed by a colorectal surgeon who is skilled in this procedure
5807,possible meniere's this seems a description of meniere's (m) which is an inner ear condition that causes episodic vertigo  nystagmus  tinnitus in the affected ear and sometimes temporary deafness at the time of an attack mri and other studies are negative in m treatment is difficult  usually done by ent docs try eliminating aspartame from diet and adding 500 mg per day of niacin and rediscuss with ent doc
5808,depends on variables if the hand carries sperm to the vagina there is the possibility of a pregnancy it is muck less likely than with intercourse  and will not occur if the sperm are dried out or otherwise made inactive prior to contact
5809,yes you could be check an over the counter pregnancy test if it is negative  check again one week later if you have not had your period
5810,lumpectomy and rt the typical treatment is a lumpectomy  where the dcis is excised from the breast and then the area is treated with radiation your doctors will discuss the pros and cons of radiation in this setting a mastectomy is an option  but does not seem necessary for such a small area after treatment  they will discuss the pros and cons of hormonal therapy (such as tamoxifen) but all cases are different
5811,second opinion symetrical (both sides) swelling/inflammation of joints is often a sign of an underlying auto-immune disease ra is one of many there are conditions that have no test for (as of yet) and they are called seronegative arthritis ( ie tests are negative ) they can be treated with the same medications as ra but it is a clinical judgement based on the doctor's analysis and the severity of complaints
5812,options you describe a grade 3 (external) hemorrhoid if the symptoms you mentioned are tolerable just follow high fiber diet and avoid dehydration to keep stools soft and easy to pass if bleeding  enlargement or pain occur would probably require hemorrhoidectomy
5813,fix it or remove it you probably have a cavity in the tooth  or some food debris on the chewing surface if you have room for the tooth in your mouth to be able to keep it clean see your dentist to fix it if there isn't room for the tooth to erupt fully into your mouth you need to have it removed by an oral & maxillofacial surgeon
5814,test not worthwhile your mammogram test is not helpful in making a diagnosis on you because your breast tissue is very thick
5815,possibly ferrous gluconate is less likely to cause constipation than the more commonly recommended ferrous sulfate ferrous glycinate (trademark ferrochel) is also better tolerated
5816,see an orthopedist who can evaluate both the ankle and the knee
5817,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
5818,doctor's opinion problems like these can only be correctly handled by your doctor in person
5819,stomach flu it sounds like a case of stomach flu (viral gastroenteritis) push fluids (gatorate and rehydration solution)  avoid caffeine  acid rich juices  dairy  fatty and fried foods rest well if worse  call your doc otherwise  you should start feeling better soon
5820,see below brain lesions that can be seen on mri that are similiar to ms can be seen with a clotting disorder known as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome if you a history of miscarriages or blood clots  you want to be to checked for this and if you have it you must quit smoking as it will elevate your risk for clots and strokes
5821,absolutely cervical spondylosis is a much more common cause of radiculopathy and nerve pain than thoracic outlet syndrome  a cervical rib  a brachial plexopathy or shoulder impingement syndrome  particularly with confirmed cervical spondylosis have a spine specialist consult the history is extremely important and the patterns emg/ncv' s are sometimes helpful  but not always
5822,er if the redness is progressing upwards  this could be indicative of cellulitis that would benefit from an intravenous does if antibiotic
5823,hard to say certainly depends on where exactly you are experiencing the pain however  common things being common  many people suffer from knee cap related pain (patellofemoral syndrome  chondromalacia patella)  often experienced as sharp pain under or deep to the kneecap rec: daily hamstring stretching  strengthening of the quadriceps (partial body weight squats  leg presses etc)
5824,fiber increase fiber in diet or take fiber supplement (e g metamucil) increased fiber intake has been shown to decrease hemorrhoidal bleeding after 2 weeks i don't think anything is going to work by tomorrow  but do avoid constipation and straining drink plenty of water good luck
5825,cervical cancer she is absolutely right the cervix is part of the uterus she is trying to save your life!
5826,rheumatologist see a rheumatologist they may run some blood tests to see if you have inflammatory arthritis  such as rheumatoid arthritis  psoriatic arthritis  etc osteoarthritis is possible also
5827,see your doctor you should go to the doctors and they can evaluate whether a treatment or drug is effective or if it is not as effective and increase or decrease dosage or change medications or change treatment plan but you need to go to your doctor for this and nothing at home will test efficacy of chemotherapy drugs for breast cancer
5828,possibly stress & anxiety--in general & in association with hormonal changes--can produce those symptoms it's usually most helpful to get a rhythm tracing during an attack  so your doctor may order a 24-hour holter monitor to try to catch one it can also help your doctor to know the hr during an episode  so i would recommend measuring your hr (counting the beats in a minute) during the next few attacks
5829,not enough info why was an mri done? small liver cysts ate common  benign & would cause no symptoms mri of the gallbladder sounds normal have you had a gallbladder ultrasound? may need hida scan to see if the gallbladder function is normal many things can cause diarrhea & nausea that is not from the gallbladder see a gastroenterology specialist for full evaluation
5830,no it is not no increased risk of medical conditions
5831,many treatments there are many types of acne scars  and many types of treatment the deep ice pick scars are best treated with excision and primary closure less dramatic depressions can often be improved with dermabrasion  chemical peels and lasers
5832,have it evaluated swelling may last a long time following a foot or ankle injury an x-ray can show if there is an underlying fracture the x-rays may be falsely negative initially in cases of small stress fractures you may have a soft tissue injury if it is just a sprain and may have damaged the muscle  tendon  or ligaments in the area have it evaluated by a professional and get the appropriate treatment
5833,either either depends on what bothers you the most
5834,cavity or wisdom ? could be either  if you haven't had your wisdom teeth removed already go see your dentist and have him/her take a radiograph to check good luck!
5835,need evaluation diffuse itching of the body is called pruritis  and can be due to impairments of the liver and ducts draining the liver a primary care doctor would be the best place to start  if you have yellowing of the skin  or of the whites of the eyes or pain under the right side of rib cage then see a gastroenterologist if liver is fine  then see allergist or dermatologist
5836,l'hermitte's ms  cervical radiculopathies  brachial plexus problems  chiari malformation  syrinx  can all cause similar complaints i assume they were also ruled out by neurologist muscles that attach to occipital for thoracic origin or scapular origin can cause this symptom with movement can it be ms  in short the answer is yes  but  the gold standard test is mri for ms
5837,confusing question papillary muscle dysfunction is diagnosed by echo therefore one cannot have a normal echo if they have papillary muscle dysfunction murmur is present when there is a valvular disease  but faint murmurs may be present with insignificant valvular disease such questions as you are asking can be confusing to both patients and the doctors ask your doctor to answer these questions for you
5838,dry skin there is something known as keratosis pilaris  flesh colored  little pimples or goose bump-like  non-itchy  likes to camp out on triceps or sides of arms  outer thighs and occasionally cheeks on the face is usually due to dry skin no scrubbing! use something like amlactin or cerave sa lotion twice daily
5839,infection this could be an abcess you should see your doctor
5840,see you doc see you doc to look for the reason of your symptoms
5841,fast heartbeat cbc & chest xray won't tell us much about fast heart rate & palpitations (unless you're anemic - have low blood count) ecg or ekg looks for abnormal electrical activity at one point in time eg wpw but if your hr is normal at time of test  then it's of no use next step is either 24hr holter monitor or loop (event) monitor  depending upon frequency of events your family doc can arrange for this
5842,probably not it is not abnormal to have dense breasts and cysts in women in their 40's as long as the cyts are 'simple' and not 'complex' as seen on ultrasound  no intervention is needed dense breasts seen on a mammogram are more difficult for the radiologist to interpret because small cancers can hide in the dense breast tissue that is why whole breast ultrasound and mri are helpful in these women
5843,pregnancy the human body is amazingly resilient such that women can get pregnant within a few months of delivering a child breastfeeding is not as effective as birth control as nor-qd (progestin-only bcp) for contraception we use progestin-only for breastfeeding moms so as not to interrupt milk supply w/more common combination bcps just be sure to take progestin-only bcps at same time daily set an alarm
5844,it is something potentially serious and therefore warrants a medical evaluation  and sooner rather than later
5845,maybe normal they maybe normal bumps see a dentist and have them evaluate the area
5846,possibly headaches are listed as common side effect of plaquenil please discuss with your prescribing doctor about this side effect
5847,fibroids? dysfunctional uterine bleeding can be caused by uterine fibroids get an ultrasound large fibroids can often be embolized by a minimally invasive technique to stop this see a good ob/gyn and a skilled interventional radiologist racing heart and dizziness caused by blood loss
5848,compartment syndrome more medical reporting of atraumatic compartment syndrome has taken place this phenomenon has basis on the ability of muscle and soft tissues to expand and swell beyond their maximal internal volume exceeding the capacity of connective tissue to bind them the result is strangulation and eventual baronecrosis of the compressed fascial compartment the condition leads to fatal myoglobinuria

5850,knot an unusual group of symptoms i worry about infection please call your doctor

5853,neurosurgeon see a neurosurgeon and he/ she will take it from there
5854,infected cyst is the bump in your vagina or on the labia? what you describe may be a sebaceous cyst (clogged hair follicle) or an infected bartholin's gland either can get infected by the normal bacteria in the area when the opening gets blocked that causes the infection the bleeding comes when you have gotten to the base of the gland or from the skin above
5855,call gyn today any change in period quality / quantity/ gastro symptoms / delay or change in date of onset must be reported to your gyn  home pregnancy tests can be inaccurate your doctor must rule out pregnancy normal / miscarriage or tubal

5858,ankle sprain if the initial injury was over 3 months ago and your ankle is still swollen and bruised  it might be more than sprained it would be helpful to see an orthopedist  and get an xray you might also need to have mri if the orthopedist suspects a ligament injury until then  it is probably making things worse to continue to play on it
5859,vaginal discharhe the fungal infection leads to cheese like or ricotta like discharge  the bacterial dischrges could be of any color and some of them have a fishy odor
5860,there's a bunch tylenol is considered the first-line pain reliever for its overall safety and efficacy unless you have a liver problem non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (nsaid's) such as ibuprofen  naprosyn  alleve  motrin  etc are also commonly used two supplements  glucosamine and chondroitin  have also been shown to be effective
5861,yes you do patellar graft  acl reconstruction is a complex knee reconstructive surgery you must follow your surgeon's instructions to get optimum results you may need physical therapy for 6months or even more

5863,need more info you definitely need to discuss with your doctor who ordered those test to give an interpretation of the blood work result what i can say here is that if you have low hb/hct and mcv and now rdw is high- that means you have anemia- and you should have some eval to find the etiology of anemia- likely is iron deficiency- but also some other etiologies have to be ruled out f/u with your md and d/w md

6045,not to worry probably s small pimple type issues if so not uncommon
6046,never heard of that i've never heard nor read of that symptom you describe as an aura or prelude to either heart attack or stroke if the taste persists you may wish to have that checked since it could indicate an actual small area of bleeding somewhere in your esophagus or pharynx meaning that the taste is not just in your head but rather it's really blood and that you'll need to fix or at least figure out

6091,panic likely try alprazolam or the like

6093,yes it can be a yeast infection or a dry vagina with skin irritation see your provider for an exam and to provide the right therapy
6094,low risk so far based on what you explained so far  your risk seems pretty low this is especially true if you are a non-smoker  and if you have a low family history risk  and if you have no other history of toxic environmental exposures however  your shortness of breath may still need to be worked up over time  and even i can't accurately predict your cancer risk with 100% certainty continue your routine care
6095,why are u testing? you don't gave hiv you did not catch hiv your sexual encounter was protected what are you doing? there was no risk your hiv tests are negative it is time to move on for gods sake there was no hiv exposure
6096,confirm diagnosis? if you physician confirms asthma as a diagnosis and not confounding panic attacks as a cause of your shortness of breathe  then she may consider adding in a medicine called singulair  which can help reduce inflammation in the lungs as a daily preventive pulmonary function tests may be useful as well good luck!
6097,see ob-gyn or pc doc i am concerned about a possible polyp or infection of your cervix due to bleeding after intercourse however  bleeding is common after miscarriages if it doesn't stop after 2 weeks  there may be retained products of conception and may need treatment also  there is the issue of rhogam immunization if you are rh negative please see your primary care physician or ob-gyn for an exam and treatment
6098,wrong drugs! try omnaris-steroid nasal spray + singulair 10mg to stop mast cells from exploding  dulera (long acting beta-agonist and inhaled steroid for prevention of attacks) rinse mouth after! xopenex hfa breakthrough inhaler  and generic xyzal for emergency oral antihistamine all have great coupons online to keep things cheap better to put drugs where the work the best and ayr saline nasal spray lots!
6099,see primary doc pedal edema can result from ibuprofen and naproxen use i have mainly seen it with celebrex  though with your history of cancer  it makes sense to rule out a deep venous thrombosis or clot please see your physician for a doppler ultrasound if necessary the fact that both legs are swollen makes that less likely still  it is best to make sure the swelling is not due to heart  kidney  or liver dz
6100,uti your doctor will need to examine you first
6101,no nay  you will be fine peel is off gently and slowly but it shouldn't hurt
6102,throat both sound like canker sores but may be bacterial or viral such as cmv if its been going on for awhile you should have it checked out
6103,see neuro and cardio it could be anything from migraine to high blood pressure  neither one would show any abnormality on ct or mri ask to see neurologist and cardiologist
6104,see your doctor for full work up blood work etc symptoms need to be looked into
6105,can regrow minoxidil has the potential for regrowth but the effect is variable and best seen in those less than 30 years of age and less than 5 years of hair loss mesotherapy has much anecdotal reports(not scientific studies) about hair regrowth but be skeptical there is also very limited data about stem cell therapy for hair regrowth  like mesotherapy  much is anecdotal
6106,cancer hi  cancer needs to be ruled out for sure  although the report doesn't say anything about what kind of mass but because it extends to pancreas makes me think the possibility of a malignancy is high now the question is where the primary source is and biopsy can give you answer and therefore a prognosis
6107,seasonal flu is very common viral infection usually the condition resolves on its own with home care drink water and get a good rest nsaids (eg aleve)  tylenol are also recommended every 6 hours if concerned  see your pcp for reevaluation
6108,can happen sometimes the viral infection will go to different areas of the body if you baby gets sicker or the blisters bumps get worse or bigger please see provider for additional treatments
6109,an option vs biopsy study: http://www ncbinlmnihgov/pmc/articles/pmc3594956 & http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/24913657 for reasonable overviews  including limitations; fat or water (ascites) in the way of fibroscan  akatransient elastography & look it up on http://scholargooglecom while not the long accepted standard  it is certainly safer than liver biopsy many additional reviews are on the web
6110,numbers are ok tsh is ok  by most labs  i am not sure about t3  but i think the problem is somewhere else  specifically an infection  given your symptoms would suggest seeing your doc as soon as possible
6111,menstrual? cannot always tell just by bleeding best to do home pregnancy test on first morning urine if negative  repeat in 7-10 days if both negative  very unlikely you are pregnant always best to use barrier method (ie condom) for all sexual encounters to help prevent pregnancy and std's hope this helps dr r
6112,infected cysts an infected cyst appears reddened  may drain pus  and is usually tender as inflammation is a prominent feature of infection it may not ache but it is tender to touch infection and inflammation do cause regional lymph nodes to react
6113,alien abscess? these sorts of things tend to recur the whole thing has to be shelled-out (enucleated) for best results often  even with the best care  remnants remain and they grow back this is assuming  of course  that it is a sebaceous cyst so  you need to have it tended to soon the green stuff? means it's not just that gooey sebum in there probably infected so like i said  get it seen soonnanu nanu!
6114,not pregnant it could be stress and uti  see your doctor to confirm it
6115,increasing neurologi compression of the spinal cord can occur due to spinal stenosis which will often cause pain in the back and or in the legs this can further progress to muscle weakness  weaker legs and paralysis if not treated in time you need to see a neurologist or a neurosurgeon to guide you in further managing this problem
6116,galactorrhea other causes meds ( ssris  risperidone  cimetadine  opiates  licorice  methyldopa  birth control pills  proton pump inhibitors  b-blockers  herbals)  growth hormone chest wall irritation/stimultion  pregnancy  and breast tumors/kidney/ lymphoma if all the above causes have been discussed  mammogram negative and normal periods there should be low concern discuss with your doctor
6117,possible pregnancy it's always possible the best thing to do is run a home urine pregnancy test they are very accurate and turn positive 10-14 days after having sex if it's negative  repeat it in 7 days if still negative  you're not pregnant from that encounter
6118,absolutely yes this is a common complaint patients say their hip hurts when they mean their groin or the lower buttock on that side in fact  that presenting symptom can delay the diagnosis of degenereative disc disease i suggest you be assessed by a pain specialist and a spine surgeon do not want to wait until you have lost motor function to have spine stabilzation epidural steroid injections help and pt
6119,consult with obgyn you won't know if your pregnant until you have a blood pregnancy test you must consult your obgyn
6120,std you have a sexually transmitted disease or a urinary tract infection there are no home remedies for this you must be seen  tested and diagnosed with the right test and then offered the correct treatment please go to the doctor
6121,yes she may have some irregular bleeding like this before her periods start--this is normal
6122,ear infection your child may have an ear infection may need antibiotics you should take the child to your md
6123,possible you can but it would be uncommon it is not clear but usually oral herpes present as a blister formation what you are describing sound more like canker soresthe cause of this is not clear but smoking  stress and viral causes have all been proposed you can talk with your doctor for the best treatment especially if they are very painful other causes have been implicated is hot foods
6124,ear fullness you could have fluid in your middle ear  or an infection see your doctor for evaluation and treatment
6125,urinary infection you have most of the symptoms of a urinary tract infection that is beginning to spread to your kidneys (pyelonephritis) this probably has no relation to your lack of period for 6 months seek medical attention asap  an urgent care or er  as a kidney infection can be very serious
6126,serious illness you have a serious gi illness likely related to the food you ate - please be checked - you may need special care and treatment
6127,not so fast i would not go on an exhaustive  expensive shot gun approach to the many many different causes of chest pain more history can help differentiate most of them if it has been awhile it is not likely a life threatening issue like pe  dissection  heart attack  etc doing unnecessary testing gives people more stress and anxiety sometimes  not saying ignore  but be prudent given age reassuring
6128,stages of puberty one rule of thumb for puberty in girls could be that if they have had menarche  i e their first menstrual cycle  for about 4 yrs  their puberty can be considered complete while stages of puberty may be different on an individual basis  pl see attached for general info more on this topic a visit and exam by her doctor would probably be helpful to assess your daughter
6129,usually low blood pressure usually is independent of anemia if you have significant anemia then you can have low bp so there are many factors involved the degree of anemia  history of hypertension amount of protein in your blood system i usually do not see high bp with anemia but it can happen
6130,spine mri? facets are the joints between the vertebra in the spine facet changes refer to degenerative bone process that can be a normal part of the aging process after a certain age we all have them  me included
6131,sounds like you need to be seen you could have a bad strep throat that requires antibiotics or even develop an abscess in the back of your throat what's also really concerning is your reported stiff neck as an infection of the head and neck can spread towards the brain(very rare) but a stiff neck isn't quite typical you'd be best served by an inperson evaluation and sooner rather than later
6132,subconjunctivalbleed with coughing some of the blood vessels under the lining of the eyes called the conjunctiva can bleed causing a very red eye the is not serious and will go away however if she develops pain or decreased vision she should be see an eye doctor right away
6133,you mentioned the most likely answer in your question: reflux try an antacid like pepcid or zantac gallbladder could also be a problem  if you still have yours if the antacids don't work  see your doctor  as you may need an ultrasound of your gallbladder hope this helps!

6135,chicken pox if it is chicken pox then it might help to see your doctor most children get vaccinated in this country  however they can still get a minor infection usually rash is less than the full blown response you treat chicken pox with acyclovir  but this depends on how bad the rash is might be worth having rash seen and then determine if it is chickenpox or not
6136,appropriate question blood in or on the stool  or black tarry stool are always of concern however  in a young person with a streak of blood on the surface of the stool  the most common causes are a fissure or hemorrhoid  both of which can cause pain as well cancer is less common in young people other causes are also less common it's best to see your doctor for a careful exam to determine the cause in your case
6137,less likely ca fabdominal cramps and diarrhea are symptoms that may come with various disease  including gastritis  food poisoning  irritable bowel syndrome  parasitic infections  diverticulitis  etc intolerance to milk products or lactase insufficiency is another cause if symptoms continute should consult internist or gastroenterologist diagnosis of cancer would be much less likely
6138,calf pain likely muscle soreness or strain try stretching leg intermittently do you keep your self enough hydrated?
6139,your alt is high about twice as high as it ought to be if you're overweight  the most likely answer is fatty liver/ nash if not  may need further investigation assuming it remains elevated
6140,you need to see a doctor personally  make an appointment today
6141,rid for lice sorry to hear that rid over-the-counter is a good place to start wash all linens  brushes  combs in hot water do not share brushes or combs with anyone
6142,most of your symptoms appear to be related to your digestive system see a gi specialist as well ad gyn specialist
6143,missed period one in four normal patients conceive per cycle since you already have missed your expected menses  i would wait one week after expected period and test
6144,depends depends on what you mean as dizzy there is vertigo  which is spinning sensation  dizziness as in light headed feeling like your going to faint  and unsteadiness when you walk i would guess you are describing the latter when you can't feel were you are walking due to numbness  it tends to throw your balance off need to find out what is causing numbness in leg pinched nerve? neuropathy?
6145,fractured ankle may need to see an orthopedic doctor for further evaluation  if not already done
6146,tooth eruption the tooth can cause pain  but usually not so much in the way of adenopathy i would be concerned about an infection and you should get checked
6147,avoid straining why does it take 2 hours for your bm? taking that long  straining to have a bm will lead to problems like hemorrhoids  fissures  and prolapse (rectum pushing to the outside) you need to drink plenty of water and eat plenty of fiber every day take a fiber supplement do not spend more than a few minutes in the bathroom if the stool does not come out  get up  walk around  be active  don't strain
6148,hyperpronation? either plantar fasciitis or pes planus(flat feet) can certainly cause significant discomfort as well as wearing very high-heeled shoes that are constrictive while standing for long periods of time for now  tenis shoes are best or a low heel and not narrow pointed toes please follow up with your pcp for a podiatry sports medicine   or orothopedics referral
6149,see a doctor trauma can result in contusions ( bruised tissues) or fractures ( broken bones) an examination is needed to determine the extent of the injury
6150,a viral infection many viruses cause a multitude of symptoms that affect the ears  nose  throat  upper airways and chest  and gastrointestinal tract along with general symptoms like headache  chills  and fever these viruses can cause all  many  or a few of the symptoms that affect the above systems most of the time supportive care using tylenol and/or motrin  fluids  and rest will help see doc if no better
6151,possible tmd having a molar removed may have placed strains on your muscles it is possible that you also have an infection in this area see your dentist to make sure what the issue is
6152,can't say the numbness is usually caused by an injury or an irritation to the nerve bundles or sheath  you should ask your dentist how close to the nerve was your tooth sometime the numbness can be transient and can last up to a year  in rare cases where the nerve was badly damaged or severed before or during the surgery that the numbness becomes permanent
6153,yes yes there is no bad interaction between the medicine you are taking and zyrtec hydrate yourself well
6154,this would be best addressed by the ob physician who is caring for you cardiac issues and gi issues that mimic cardiac issues can be developed newly during pregnancy  and the farther along you are  the greater those risks become call ob and at least have them check your blood pressure how is baby? moving and active is good sometimes women develop gallstones or even pancreatitis during pregnancybest be seen 2day
6155,possibly those women who are sexually active without using birth control usually get the name mother at some point in time you should definitely do a home pregnacy test if it is negative  repeat it in ten days if the second one is negtive then you are probably not pregnant if either one is positive  make an appointment to start your prenatal care as soon as possible
6156,see a neurologist paresthesia also called oral numbness occur following restorative and surgical dental procedures even administration of local anesthetic could be a cause of the paresthesia the bottom line  paresthesia is a nerve damage disorder and should be treated as a neuropathy by a neurologist
6157,yes for significantly sore throat w swollen tonsils / lymph nodes – see physician & get a strep throat test & culture antibiotics are imperative for strep throat try saltwater gargles mix tsp of salt in 8 oz of warm water – gargle w this several times/day you can gargle w aloe vera juice a couple of times per day a mix of chamomile tea w honey & a small amt of lemon juice helps
6158,anemia high rbc rules out the diagnosis of anemia  but how high decides the need for the treatment or not b12 and hdl are low  both need to be treated
6159,maybe if you have had unprotected sex then yes you could be pregnant mid cycle spotting not likely the reason for late period but pregnancy is check home pregnancy test with first morning urine if neg  repeat in 7-10 days if both neg  unlikely you are pregnant fibroids not associated with late period can be associated with heavy bleeding or pain with period hope this helps best of luck

6211,many causes some common causes 1 bulging disc 2 diabetes 3 b12 anemia (alcohol) 4 medication side effect 5 nerve degeneration 6 poor circulation
6212,try embolization there are many options for fibroids  but relatively few for adenomyosis if hormonal therapies don't work the choices are limited hysterectomy is curative  but difficult to consider in a young woman there is emerging evidence that embolization can provide good results for adenomyosis as well as fibroids and allow uterine preservation and at least a chance of fertility
6213,check w your rheum having 4 negative joint aspirations makes gout less likely other multi joint problems (poly articular arthropathies) may not show up on rheumatoid panels  though a general inflammation test such as an esr or crp will normally be elevated) you should get a diagnosis bc many good medications are available to treat rheumatologic diseases today

6216,rash can you send a picture?
6217,can't tell the test you stated above is a thyroid ultrasound it is not a scan you can't tell if something is hot or cold definitively on a thyroid ultrasound you need a thyroid scan (using radioactive iodine) to know if something is hot or cold if your tsh was normal  you probably didn't have a scan for a nodule that small (3 mm)

6220,couple possibilities could be recurrent sinus problems or 'muscle tension' headache  but the key may be the feelings of tightness & temple pain these are most commonly seen with muscle tension hathe cause  however  is likely coming from your neck (called cervicogenic ha)a good history & phys ex  esp osteopathic hands-on exam might find the cause (esp if jointmuscle) & provide treatment via osteopathic manipulation

6245,the t-1-c stage means it is bigger than some clear indication for anti-hormone (tamoxifen/anastrazole) i might consider oncotype testing tissue to discern benefit from chemo  but if you would not take it regardless of results  don't waste your money
6246,radiation burns radiation therapy causes a type of burn resulting in injury hopefully cancer cells are killed  but normal tissue heals with some effects of tissue scarring
6247,pet could help a pet scan could be helpful as any malignancy greater than 1 cm in size should be hot small tumors can be behind folds or stool or be missed on colonoscopy for other reasons a small intestinal cancer would not be found on upper or lower endoscopy if the doctors are certain that the tumor is not a primary liver tumor  a pet scan should definitely be done
6248,possible chalazion if it involves the lower eyelid not the upper cheek it is probably a chalazion which is inflammation of a clogged meibomian oil gland treatment consists of warm compresses and massage and surgical drainage if no resolution after about a month if the surrounding skin area becomes inflamed a preseptal cellulitis could be occurring which would require systemic antibiotics
6249,small difference in balloon sinuplasty we just dilate the natural sinus openings with a balloon there is no cutting or removal of tissue in endoscopic sinus surgery we usually remove various blockages along the sinus openings and widen these openings so they do not block up balloon can really only be used in certain patients with mild chronic sinusitis  no polyps  no ethmoid sinus disease and no septal deviati

6297,not typical corneal abrasion is unusual but can occur and usually heals within a few days macular edema is more serious and is treated with nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drops macular pucker or epiretinal membranes can predispose to cystoid macular edema retinal examination prior to cataract surgery can identify eyes at risk unless the density of the cataract prevents an adequate retinal examination
6298,get it evaluated you will need to have it professionally evaluated you will need x-rays taken to determine the location and orientation of the fragment if you have significant pain and your physician feels that removing the bone fragment will be beneficial  then you should consider having the fracture fragment removed
6299,lasik or prk in general  results for nearsightedness and regular astigmatism are very good with either treatment many people achieve excellent vision after these treatments it would be important to know why someone could not wear contacts - as in cases of irregular astigmatism where laser correction would not be an option
6300,a a lensectomy is essentially a premature cataract surgery  meaning your natural lens has not fully developed a cataract (clounding of natural lens) this can be an excellent option for patients in their late 50's early 60's who want to correct astigmatism and nearsightedness and avoid developing cataracts later if you are younger  you could consider lasik or prk everyone who lives long enough will develop cataracts  most during the 60's or 70's thus if you are closer to this age range  you might consider lensectomy  it is like one stop shopping correct vision and avoid cataract surgery the lenses today are advanced and can correct both astigmatism and nearsightedness there are even lenses that provide both distance and near vision  discuss with your surgeon the best option
6301,sleep apnea sleep apnea can cause depression decreased sex drive decreased attention  concetration  memory etc
6302,you you should have a ct scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a good look at the liver and spleen also make sure you get a cbc  if your white count is elevated then the lymph node should be investigated lastly  since you are a smoker and have had such a significant weight loss  a cxr is also a good idea best of luck
6303,could be many things enlargement of lymph node can be caused by many things- like trauma/irritation around the area  infection - bacterial  viral etc  autoimmune disease  cancer etc judging from the duration of your problem- things like irritation/trauma to the left upperarm/arm pit- ie shaving  boils  scratching over the skin on left arm etc- can cause the enlargement of the lymph node there
6304,possible neuropathy depending on the affected nerves  symptoms of diabetic neuropathy can range from a numbness and tingling sensation  possibly a burning sensation  to an uncomfortable painful sensation of the extremities neuropathy may affect your digestive system  urinary tract  blood vessels and the heart for some people  the symptoms are mild; for others  it can be painful and disabling
6305,an an ultrasound can suggest what it is bit is not definitive an ultrasound looks at fluid changes so for a cyst it is good to see the transition from the awl of the cyst to the inside fluid layer stll where it is can also influence the ultrasounds ability to discern detail ie behind a bone the sound waves may not get through as well while the tech may give someone preliminary info one really needs to wait for the formal report and for the ordering physician to review it and make sur the findings correspond and are relevant to the problem this last reason is why a lot of physicians/surgeons are starting to do their own musculoskeletal ultrasound in their own office setting the ability for a surgeon who knows the anatomy primarily to see structures and do a relevant physical exam at the same time becomes of great value
6306,to to add to dr dyro's answer  ms can affect the spinal cord as well as the brain  so if a brain mri was not conclusive but a spinal cord mri was not done  ms has certainly not been excluded as to whether autonomic neuropathy can be fatal  it is unusual but can happen  if low blood pressure affects the heart or brain  causing loss of consciousness which can then cause serious trauma depending on when it happens if you have syncope and fall you could injure yourself substantially usually the various manifestations of peripheral or autonomic neuropathy can be treated symptomatically with some benefit but the underlying disease process is often not treatable with current knowledge and technology
6307,cold foot if these are new symptoms that you are experiencing i would see a vascular doctor for further evaluation
6308,typically typically ingrown toe nails cause a localized infection of the skin surrounding the nail (cellulitis) which could eventually lead to an abscess if left untreated what you described sounds more like cellulitis the treatment for this is antibiotics the treatment for an abscess is the same  however in some case it may need to be opened and drained if your primary care doctor is not treating your problem then you should ask for a referral to a podiatrist (foot doctor) you also probably need the ingrown toe nail to be surgically removed best of luck
6309,hard hard to tell without a picture  but perhaps he has either eczema or molluscum contagiosum take a look at the picture below to see if it looks similar to molluscum if so  i would visit a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options i hope that helps
6310,he he should take an anti-histamine daily (i e claritin  alavert  zyrtec) in addition he should take a daily acid blocker like pepcid or prilosec also consider trying benadryl at night to see if this helps slow down the mucous production he should also avoid dairy products  as they tend to increase mucous production if he has not seen an allergist  he should go for allergy testing if he has certain allergies  this can contribute to his problem lastly  he needs a follow up appointment with the ent (ear  nose  throat) specialist for further work up and treatment plan
6311,yes there is also the hormonal class of medication
6312,there there are a wide variety of problems that occur in this area  including baker's cysts  meniscal tears  pcl tears  tendinitis  nerve injuries  popliteal artery aneurysms  and some growths (most benign and some cancerous) the best thing to do is to see an orthopaedic surgeon and have it examined and x-rayed some problems will need mri there are a lot of important anatomical parts in that area and it should not be ignored
6313,yes in these cases radiation would be used as a palliative treatment as opposed to a curative one depending on the size  location  number of lesions  the patient' s performance status  and other factors radiation can be a very effective treatment sometimes stereotactic body radiation can be used on the liver also  some patients may be candidates for microspheres treatment for the liver
6314,overdue if you haven't had one for ten years you're overdue even if you haven't had a cuts
6315,i'm i'm sorry your son is having so much trouble with this chest pain since he was diagnosed with a valve problem   and beta blockers were recommended as a potential treatment  i presume he's dealing with mitral valve prolapse (mvp)  which is usually a benign condition however  it can sometimes cause significant chest pain  and beta blockers might alleviate this discomfort if other causes of your son's chest pain have been ruled out (his cardiology workup should have accomplished that)  then a trial of preventive beta blocker therapy is reasonable he doesn't necessarily need to return home for that; his cardiologist might be able to arrange appropriate treatment after consulting with the physician in north carolina keep in mind that beta blockers -- like nearly all medications -- can cause side effects  such as dizziness  fatigue  slowed heartbeat  and poor exercise tolerance talk to the cardiologist about the risks and benefits of beta blocker therapy if he feels comfortable prescribing medications without seeing your son again  then your son can continue his studies otherwise  you can bring him home for reevaluation i've attached a link that provides more information about mvp i hope things go well! http://wwwmedicinenetcom/mitral_valve_prolapse/articlehtm
6316,hello hello i cannot diagnose your condition however  with history of difficulty swallowing  swollen lymph nodes and generalized malaise  it would be prudent to get seen so that you can get a strepth test your medical provider may need to investigate more if those nodes don't start going down in size
6317,check with doctor the cipro should have covered a uti but sometimes resistant bacteria will not respond the amoxicillin might help but you are likely to get some diarrhea and possible yeast infections with all of the antibiotics
6318,trachea still cf the graft of new lungs does leave a trachea that still has the cf defect this can serve as a source of infection to the new lungs the new transplanted lungs though will not have cf disease
6319,overdue to see an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in ankle/foot
6320,the the single most common cause of heel pain is plantar fasciitis  an inflammation of a ligament that begins in the heel but the typical scenario of plantar fasciitis is that it starts slowly  with good days  then bad days  then good days again  with the patient usually describing the pain as worst after rest  like that first step in the morning getting out of bed it usually takes months before patients seek medical help for plantar fasciitis if you can't even bear weight on your heel  i wonder if you have a stress fracture of your heel bone x-rays hardly ever show such small little fractures  but the pain can be intense i would suggest an mri  with 3 mm cuts (narrower than usual in order to pick up a tiny break) stress fractures of the heel bone can be very frustrating for both doctor and patient assuming no other underlying medical problems that would cause heel pain (and there are a number of them)  getting an mri would be my best suggestion at this point i hope you feel better good luck!
6321,yes you can consider blepharoplasty but your dry eye needs to be treated before the surgery
6322,get tested do i have std? = get tested; regardless of symptoms get a urinalysis and get treated with yeast infection at the same time
6323,research research varies in terms of when it is 'too late' to improve vision in patients with lazy eye most eye doctors agree that the critical period of time to treat is between 4 and 9 years of age the problem is that lazy eye  which is actually called amblyopia  is a problem where the wiring between the eye and the brain does not form properly and once you are hard wired  it can't change if an eye wanders consistently  then surgery on the muscles can be performed to straighten out the eye
6324,a a rash with raised red bumps is called a maculopapular rash and can be caused by many  many things such as: -food or drug allergy -viral infections such as fifths disease  roseola  ebv  cmv  molluscum just to name a few -insect bites such as fleas or scabies -bacterial infection such as scarlet fever (caused by strep) -medication reaction or it can be seen in very rare things such as: -measles -toxic shock syndrome -kawasaki disease -meningitis -stevens-johnson syndrome -rocky mountain spotted fever disease the list goes on and on the best thing to do is to call your child's doctor they may want to take a look to see what it may be odds are that if your child does not have a high fever or is not acting sick  then it's probably nothing serious
6325,hello hello two issues jump out here first  you have seen the cadilac of bladder doctors; a urologist; and he has recommended this procedure second  asking doctors on line if you should get this surgery (who have not met you  examined you physically  taken a history or looked at your specialty studies) is like taking the option that is way below a vw bug the specialist visualized a large mass during your cystoscopy have you asked what the possibility is that those could be a cancerous lesion? if it was my body  i would want to make sure that i didn't have cancer i can't make this important medical decision for you i suspect you are hoping that the problem will just go away but with the history you have provided  i think that not getting this procedure would be like playing russian roulette if you need to  pray about this but by all means  do take care
6326,hello hello i can't diagnose your symptoms however  it does sound a lot like podagra which is when the base of the big toe contains uric acid crystals if you have not been evaluated for possible gout  recommend that you do so in the mean time you might consider pain control through a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication like motrin hope your pain is relieved soon take care
6327,probably probably not there are certain anesthetics that can last 6 to 10 hours it depends on what your surgeon used can you call their office and ask? take it easy the rest of the evening and in a short while you will start to get the feeling back
6328,it it may or may not worsen  but it will not improve without wearing correction perhaps contact lenses would be a better solution ask your eye doctor is this is possible
6329,short short of a tracheostomy (hole placed in the throat to breath) cpap is considered the gold standard for treating osa because of it's effectiveness not knowing your ahi it is difficult to determine the severity of your disability  though  from the symptoms your describe  it appears to be high depending upon the level/location of your obstruction there are other treatment modalities that may be considered  such as surgery or an oral appliance all have their advantages and disadvantages you should discuss your situation with your sleep management doctor rest assured your complaints are not uncommon with patients who use cpap
6330,sounds like there is something irritating the area either an infection or an ingrown toenail see a podiatrist or general surgeon
6331,propranolol propranolol can potentially mask your hypoglycemic symptoms especially if you are not easily symptomatic when low i suggest that you correlate your symptoms of feeling low and level of bs and if you get only symptomatic when very low  then i would recommend that you discuss this with your physician who prescribed it to see if you can be switched to a non beta blocker medication (there is many pharmacological alternatives for your migraines) i personally recommend against use of non selective beta blockers in any one who has diabetes or asthma keep a close eye on your bs especially at 2-3am if your bs at bedtime are on the low side good luck cayce t jehaimi  md  faap pediatric endocrinology & diabetes the children's hospital of southwest florida fort myers  fl usa

6339,common issue this is a common issue seen in women due toill-fitting (too small) shoes get fit in properly sized shoes with adequate padding in this area and if pain persists  go see a podiatrist
6340,depends on symptoms ct head good to do first then mri with and or without contrast as indicated see radiologyinfoorg each test meets acr appropriateness criteria

6349,neurochemistry 101 persistent activation of central nervous system nmda receptors by the excitatory amino acid glutamate has been hypothesized to contribute to the symptomatology of alzheimer’s disease namenda is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action by blocking nmda receptors namenda is approved by the fda for the treatment of moderate to severe alzheimer's dementia
6350,yes  old antihistam you can still the old antihistamines for daily use which are very inexpensive before the new expensive antihistamines came into picture medications such as chlorpheneramine and brompheneramine (which are available over the counter) for a very low price were used just talk to your friendly pharmacists and they will tell you where they are avialble you will do fine

6353,some time dr luedecke and dr davantzis gave you great answers normal referring to numbness gone or back to normal as before you had the teeth removed? everything is highly dependent upon the extent of your surgery  the amount of bone removed  the specific anesthesia  your tendency to swell  your recuperative powers  the skill of your surgeon  etc hopefully you will heal quickly
6354,chest x-rays many but not all lung cancers can be detected on chest x-rays ct scans are much more sensitive tests only by accident will an echo detect a lung tumor
6355,acute graves disease this is most likely acute graves disease but can be brain disease origin you need to see an ophthalmologist quickly and probably will need the services of others also this mix of signs and symptoms is extremely bothersome

6361,unknown there have not been any definitive studies looking at the effects of exercise on recovery from dvts; minor activity  such as walking  has been shown to be safe within weeks after diagnosis theoretically  there may be some benefits and some down sides related to more vigorous activity in general  i advise my patients to wait 3 months before running (and to wear compression stockings)
6362,electrolytes you probably have an electrolyte imbalance try taking a magnesium/potassium supplement (unless you have kidney problems - then discuss with your doctor)
6363,no as per my previous teachings on this site all laser vision techniques are just a small fraction amontg the entire vision corrective surgery spectrum so a patient can be acandidate based on which surgery is best suited to him/her glasses and contact lenses are symbiotic non surgical options therein and optometrists care can be till you reach age for candiday or as an adjunct treatment
6364,cannot determine every patient is different  and the only person who could answer this effectively would be the rheumatologist treating you if they will not answer the question or you are not satisfied  suggest finding a second opinion
6365,comfortable  no pull hearing loss with ear infection is temporary and will go away as the fluid in the middle ear clears unfortunately  the fluid lasts longer than the infection if he is sleeping well and not fussy or feverish  the antibiotic is likely working  but fluid can take 6 or 8 weeks to clear  and his hearing will get better slowly your doctor can look again if you are in doubt
6366,scfe see orthopedic surgeon for screw fixation/orif also get endocrine and thyroid work up
6367,other symptoms? most likely caused by an infection do you have any other signs of an infection  rash in the area  fever  pain of the lymph node? assuming you are not sick  you could just watch it over the next week or two enlarged lymph nodes from infections can sometimes take 1-2 months to go away if it doesn't  or if new nodes appear in other places  see your doc it might not be an enlarged lymph node

6371,knee surgery if you've maximized conservative treatment  including gel injections  cortisone injections  weight control  nsaids  omega  pain meds  then check with orthopedic surgeon for possible tka  uni knee  or osteotomy
6372,yes  call antibiotics can indiscriminately kill all kinds of bacteria  and there are some that are normal and helpful in maintaining the correct balance your throat infection could be coincidentally of viral origin  or the amoxicillin may have caused this imbalance i spoke of and allowed a fungal or candidal infection either way  an md consult would be beneficial and correct btw  pen or amox?
6373,probably you likely have a pericoronitis this is an infection under the gum tissue covering part of that wisdom tooth you may be biting it with the top tooth as well hot salt water rinses and ibuprofen right away get to the oral surgeon asap to get this treated infection can get much worse and be life threatening if left too long good luck

6382,various the are various causes of recurrent early embryo failures this can be a problem with the chromosomes in either partner that can be checked with a blood test other causes include uterine septum  hypercoagulable blood and autoimmune issues there is a work-up that can be performed to evaluate for possible treatable causes
6383,fair the diseases you describe are not strictly inherited there is a genetic component but it is variable your best defense is to live a healthy lifestyle do not smoke  eat a healthy diet  stay at a healthy weight because dm  htn are so common you stand a chance of geting these with or without your family history
6384,neurologist  mri first  don't panic uneven pupils  aka anisocoria  are often due to a benign condition like migraines which would also explain the eye pain and headaches however  more serious causes like multiple sclerosis and brain tumors are possible you should see a neurologist who will likely order an mri of the brain as part of a complete evaluation
6385,probably yes! typically a 7 inch (18 cm) mass in the breast would require surgical removal although a benign biopsy result is very comforting  when a mass is so large  it is impossible to evaluate the entire lesion for cancer without removal cancer may occupy part of a large mass and not involve other parts
6386,more than one thing it truly sounds like more than one thing is going on mid-back is your kidneys  but not lower back could be stress  drinking too much water  taking medications with diuretic effects  but is really sounds like stress and anxiety you are not pregnant!

6389,infection? seeing your family doc is certainly advised
6390,follow advice lymph nodes enlarge for many reasons  most often from some type of infectious process benign lymph nodes will tend to decrease in size (not necessarily to normal though) as the infection or inflammation resolves if there is no need for antibiotics or other treatment for infection  waiting is appropriate further enlargement  especially if the node is >1 cm  requires further investigation
6391,avulsion pain is to be expected and diminishing as healing occurs the pain in the calf could be a clot - see your podiatrist right away
6392,many things here is the list - pityriasis rosea  eczema  pyogenic granuloma  etc skin issues are difficult to diagnoses without seeing them - if it persists  seek care
6393,complex tmj does not cause true hearing loss see ent asap if sudden hearing loss  is ent emergency you need the care of a tmj specialist any dentist can be a tmj expert with the proper training and experience most commonly  oral surgeons  prosthodontists  and orofacial pain specialists ask your md  your dentist and your dental society for referrals
6394,could be either the symptoms you describe could indicate either a bacterial or viral infection; although statistically  viral infections are more common an examination will be important the fact that you had a flu shot is great but flu shots only protect against the 2-4 worst strains of influenza flu for that season; it doesn't protect against the thousands of other strains of flu best to see your doctor
6395,ok  let's see  do u sleep well at night? clinch or grind teeth at night? wake up with your hands numb? is pain in lower  upper or mid back? was there an injury? any medical problems one thing to consider is hand splints at night in case it's carpal tunnell syndrome folate deficiency is a rare source the hand and arm pain may be seperate or relegated to back and headaches let's do private conv if this fits u

6398,hematoma following acl surgery especially if your own (autologous) bone patellar tendon bone graft is taken swelling  bruising in the ankle is not uncommon just make sure that you are not having any sharp calf pain where a doppler ultrasound would be helpful to be performed to rule out a blood clot
6399,ibs does not cause bloody diarrhea with clots you need to see a ghi doctor or colorectal surgeon promptly for a colonoscopy and work up do not delay ibs is not the correct diagnosis
6400,yes the allergens in fish and seafood are flesh or meat proteins the vitamin d in milk is not derived from fish
6401,it&#x27;s simple see a dentist who is trained to evaluate these types of things you are not trained and can't be expected to accurately determine whether or not your tooth is infected that's true regardless of whatever we can describe to you on the internet if you must know  swelling  pain  redness  heat and fever are typical signs of an infection
6402,unlikely a urine pregnancy test should be positive if you conceived with an iui cycle- 14 days after the iui make sure you are using a name brand kit and followed the instructions to increase accuracy sorry! :( if you are not sure about the urine test call your doctor to have a blood pregnancy test done if your period has not started

6547,what is your diet low blood sugar does not mean diabetes  people who are excessively dieting may have their blood glucose  or if you were fasting at the time the blood test was drawn  will show low blood sugar; however  a blood glucose of 70 is not abnormal  unless you are having symptoms such as sweating  light headed  palpitation etc  when the blood glucose is 70  then excessive secretion of insulin may cause it
6548,silent gallstones the answer is no  you do not need to do anything about gallstones that are causing no problems you just need to be aware of what the typical symptoms of gall bladder inflammation from obstruction by the gallstones are like in order to recognize the situation in which your gallstones progress from being silent (asymptomatic) to symptomatic there is no harm in waiting

6557,pt as tolerated pt can exacerbate the pain from a meniscal tear if it does so  you need to be re-evaluated by your orthopedic surgeon as to whether you are a candidate for arthroscopic surgery also pt is as tolerated so some of the exercises you may not be ready this should be part ofte discussion you have with your doc

6583,sorethroatonabudget most sore throats are viral in nature - meaning antibiotics won't help - strep throat is a bacterial infection that can be tested for and easily treated without going to a doctor your options are limited to warm tea  salt water gargles 1/4 teaspoon of salt in 4 oz of warm water - gargle and spit out throat lozenges may provide symptomatic relief as well
6584,need to have nail removed and antibiotics if pus is noted the meat is likely the nail bed or tissue under the nail don't delay seeing a podiatrist

6586,see your ob/gyn see your ob/gyn who will do a work up for your symptoms
6587,floater-ectomy! there are surgeons in this country who will do surgery to remove floaters  but they usually wait up to a year before offering surgery this is because the floater-ectomy can cause floaters usually the floater must be constant  and in the center of vision i also agree that if it is new  it should be examined by your cataract surgeon

6596,blood from fissure bright red blood is low down in the gi tract  possible just above anal canal that may be derived from a fissure with a neg ct scan and colonoscopy  bleeding from a lesion of bowel ruled out occasionally a av malformation can result in bleeding but neither are related to pain in lower rt in male one should look at some low grade inflammation around the appendix
6597,yes you could be check an over the counter pregnancy test if it is negative  check again one week later if you have not had your period
6598,am most swelling you will be most swollen in the morning the day after ice helps stabilize so it does not get bigger get ice on it but it may not make it go down avoid heavy exercise  also bending over like working in the garden but still move around  be up right doing normal things swelling around the jaw muscles may restrict opening some advil  motrin  type meds are helpful

6605,yes and no this is not an uncommon side affect of the surgery in most cases full feeling comes back but it can months it depends on how difficult the extraction was
6606,perhaps benign the mri truly needs clinical correlation  as the ischemic white matter disease is not uncommonly seen with atherosclerotic changes of aging  and the atrophy may potentially be c/w aging also but if associated with memory loss or changes in your cognition  could correlate with a progressive dementia perhaps query your doctor as to why test was done and if it confirms a clinical problem
6607,depends was the small lesion on the uterus colon cancer? was it attached to the colon cancer itself? was a hysterectomy needed? if it is a separate cancerous nodule  then yes it would be metastatic disease  stage 4 you need to go over all the findings carefully with the surgeon & medical oncologist  who may need to review all the findings with the pathologist to determine the best treatment choices
6608,brain lesions and symptoms of ms may overlap and are similar with other autoimmune conditions trust your dr quitting smoking will help prevent worsening of your symptoms eating more fruits and veggies and exercising regularly will boost your immune system best wishes!http://wwwautoimmunemomcom/vitamins-herbs/top-five-herbs-for-autoimmunehtml

6611,not enough info why was an mri done? small liver cysts ate common  benign & would cause no symptoms mri of the gallbladder sounds normal have you had a gallbladder ultrasound? may need hida scan to see if the gallbladder function is normal many things can cause diarrhea & nausea that is not from the gallbladder see a gastroenterology specialist for full evaluation

6626,get seen it's gout until proved otherwise and you don't want to wait
6627,probably not  but it sounds like there are quite a few symptoms that should be evaluated an echocardiogram would tell about your heart function and potentially if there are any heart structural reasons for fatigue  palpitations  shortness of breath an event monior would help assess if there is a heart rhythm cause of palpitations an 18yo with hypertension is unusual- will need consideration for other causes
6628,see you doc see you doc to look for the reason of your symptoms
6629,see a primary doctor it could be red because you worry and palpate it often how big this lump  how superficial? your primary doctor should evaluate lesion and decide do you need any invasive procedures: fine needle aspiration or biopsy  or it is pimple-skin acne? if it is breast lump  could be benign fibroadenoma or fibrocystic changes ( even no cysts and no fluid) thank you for question
6630,coronary artery disease bad enough to produce a heart attack is not only very rare in 30 year olds  it is also highly unlikely to produce nighttime symptoms (it usually gets worse with exercise ) anxiety (panic attack) is the most likely cause of symptoms like this  although heartburn  arrhythmia  and pericarditis are also possible
6631,possibly possibly  if not simple indigestion
6632,yes but there's more what you were prescribed is a very common form of treatment when diverticulitis is suspected or confirmed the premise of rx is to kill the bacteria that are lodged in the affected diverticular pocket--in reducing the infection thus reduce the inflammation repeated bouts of diverticulitis  especially in the same location  warrant investigation & possibly surgery to remove the diseased colon area
6633,yes there are several laser  radio frequency  and non-energy treatments for acne scarring fully ablative and partially ablative co2 lasers  erbium lasers  e-matrix  and dermaroller treatments are all options
6634,probably not many women find that sex is more enjoyable after a hysterectomy most women do not experience a decrease in the sex drive after a hysterectomy
6635,statistically at your age the most probable answer is a primary headache disorder (migraine/tension)  now frequent and bad because driven by something (stress  hormones  other) however  this is a statistical statement the problem with diagnosing by symptoms alone (no test findings) is no proof  and sometimes the right answer is the improbable answer need formal evaluation
6636,sometime a ruptured ligament needs to be repaired if complete rupture then inquire about having a repair often times it takes less time to heal

6987,yes  normal though some pregnant women have breast tenderness  not all women experience symptoms early on in pregnancy at ten weeks  your belly would not be expected to be larger than normal  since the baby is still very small if you haven't already  you should visit an ob/gyn for your first prenatal appointment

6995,is it surgical? what is the means by which you are getting your teeth aligned? if it is braces/orthodontics alone  i would be less inclined to call it surgery  although it may be done for a cosmetic reason if you are getting crowns or veneers purely for cosmetic reasons then yes its cosmetic  and could be considered surgery  depending on your definition of surgery sorry if that may sound vague
6996,couple possibilities often called 'sciatica'  generically  but has several potential causes most drs think of disc herniation  but other causes include minor disc tears w/out hernia  though commonly vertebral dysf or sacroiliac jt dysf  are at fault a good history & phys incl hands-on osteopathic exam may reveal the causeosteopathic manipulation may cure the latter 2  but still be of help if other causes found

7023,mammogram mammograms are generally better at screening for breast cancer ultrasound is used more for a focus evaluation of an area of the breast that might be suspicious or appear abnormal
7024,very tolerable today long term side effects from breast radiation are much less likely with modern techniques today as opposed to techniques used just nine or ten years ago it also depends on the doctors skill sets and equipment it also depends upon whether or not the xrt is only to the breast or also needs i include the lymph nodes under arm and above collar bone mostly cosmetic with increased density of breast
7025,causes painfull knee if without repair usually very rapid max is two weeks if repair is done it take six weeks to be able to recover if knee remains warm and painful there is three common cause low thyroid  gout   or rheumatoid arthritis do tsh(needs to be below 20)  rf  and uric acid(needs to be below 60)

7041,what's the cause ? cellulitis is basically a visible inflammation (itis) of the skin and soft tissues (red  hot  swollen and tender)  it can be caused by many things including sunburn (radiation)  trauma (sprained ankle) or poor vein circulation (stasis dermatitis) it need not be caused by bacteria if you have repeated episodes of this  get to a wound care or vascular specialist  the diagnoses you have is wrong
7042,may help  not hurt generally antioxidant supplements when used in recommended dosage along with healthy diet/exercises should not do you harm in your case of multiple chemo agents being used for cancer  antioxidants may help reduce some oxidative stresses that your body is undergoing at this time however  i would recommend that you let your physicians know about what you taking so they can monitor good luck

7052,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
7053,hard to know could have been a lot of things some of which are serious should tell your doctor

7062,no heart attacks are typically a result of platelets sticking together and blocking an artery in the heart aspirin blocks the platelets ability to stick together decreasing the chance that a blockage (heart attack) will occur for this reason  aspirin is one of the most effective medicines ever discovered for the prevention of heart attacks neither tylenol or ibuprofen has this effect
7063,probably you can combine aspirin and ibuprofen but they are both harsh on the stomach take it with food
7064,could be other among the causes for those symptoms are gallbladder disease (not enough info given to say you have that) as well as gut/stomach issues including ulcers  celiac disease  other get checked for other things
7065,no if your serum hcg was negative at 23 days late then you are unlikely to be pregnant

7074,maybe if the metastatic disease to the chest is minimal or only in lymph nodes a ct scan of the chest may be more sensitive to detect it compared to a chest xray
7075,see a doctor this can easily be diagnosed and treated by your local primary care physician  while making sure there is nothing more serious going on you should be better very soon
7076,no such thing there isn't actually such an entity per se but people with diabetes tend to develop accelerated atherosclerosis which tends to affect the smaller (distal) vessels to a greater extent than non-diabetics that could result in angina (chest pain)but often doesn't because diabetics lose the ability to perceive pain dizziness and cold fingers are non-specific issues caused by many things
7077,no even men can have mammograms the way they are done doesn't really depend on the size of the breasts in all cases  the brest tissue is flattened and the x-ray passes through the breast  hope this helps

7081,thanks thanks for your question! after having liquid nitrogen treatment for plantar warts  it is not unusual to have some mild redness around the treatment area this is called reactive erythema and is a sign of the inflammation around the area that was treated however  redness that is warm and/or painful  or that spreads or that drains pus  can be a sign of cellulitis - a bacterial infection of the skin it can be difficult for patients to tell the difference sometimes i would recommend seeing your doctor right away to determine if antibiotics are needed if it is cellulitis  the most common bacteria that cause infection in this area are staphylococcus and streptococcus you may have heard of a bacteria that is more difficult to treat with antibiotics called methicillin resistent staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) there are also other bacteria that can cause the infection but these are the most common cephalexin is a common choice for skin infections but would likely not be effective for mrsa after examining your foot  your doctor can make an educated decision regarding which antibiotic is right for you  taking into account which medications you are already taking  your allergies  and your examination never take antibiotics unless they are prescribed by a medical professional for your specific problem it can be dangerous to take leftover medications from a previous infection or to purchase antibiotics on the internet at best  it can confuse the picture for your doctor if a wound culture is needed i wish you the best!

7083,biopsies most breast needle biopsies today are core biopsies that remove variably sized intact core tissue samples  as opposed to fine needle aspiration biopsies that remove cells and small fragments there are different types of core biopsies: vacuum assisted and automated gun types
7084,angioplasty angioplasty (stent placement) is a procedure to mechanically alleviate the obstruction in a particular area of the coronary artery it does not cure the underlying disease process and does not prevent other areas to develop blockages in some circumstances the area of angioplasty (stent) may re-narrow causing the blockage to recur in the same area
7085,up the trazadone i would increase the trazodone you can take up to 300 mg  and 100 mg is not a high dose try to decrease the alprazolam  or only use at bedtime if possible  due to it's addictive qualities if that wears off  it may cause you to wake up
7086,sting that is a pretty significant reaction and could also be a spider bite see your allergist for testing
7087,based based on the symptoms you described you could be dealing with pharyngitis (infection of the throat) which could be caused by a bacterial or a virus; versus a sinus infection other more serious less likely possibilities include influenza (flu) or meningitis (infection of the central nervous system) regardless  you need to see your health care provider right away; the provider will ask you specific questions about your illness and perform a physical exam you can expect that your provider will likely perform a throat culture or a test called a rapid strep test and possibly blood tests to check for certain infections your doctor/provider will make a decision based on the test results regarding which treatment is appropriate if a more serious problem is suspected  your doctor will likely send you to the emergency department
7088,it it is hard to say what you should do about the mole without an examination your best bet is to have it examined by a dermatologist more worrisome features are skin growths that are asymmetric  have irregular borders  have multiple colors  are larger diameter than a pencil eraser head

7092,in the short term- y good morning! almost all facial lifting procedures can lead to some temporary numbness after surgery- but when properly performed  this tends to resolve over 1 to 4 months there are many variations to a deep plane facelift and while the superficial skin nerves are more likely to be spared  the deeper  larger nerves are in fact more at risk and can potentially lead to a a longer term numbness
7093,yes those symptoms could all reflect a colon cancer  and that is what needs to be ruled out by a physician it could possilby be other causes  diverticular disease  ibs  malabsorption syndromes  but the most worrisome possible cause (colon cancer) still remains pretty high on the list of possibilities seek medical attention please!
7094,it's it's hard to say without examining you whether you actually have an infection  an abscess  or just an overgrowth of granulation tissue from the ingrown nail if your primary care doctor is unable to help you  you may want to contact a podiatrist in your area if needed  they can cut out the piece of the nail that is ingrown - sometimes at the root of the nail - and apply a medication to stop the nail from re-growing in that spot and becoming ingrown again in the meantime  make sure you are soaking your toe in warm water 2-3 times a day for 20 minutes at a time if it is worsening instead of improving  or if you have increased redness  swelling  pain  drainage  or fever  call your doctor immediately

7104,i i would not want to speculate as to what the black spot is without an examination if this is a new spot that is on your gums and does not go away  then you should definitely go back to your dentist to have it evaluated i do not understand or agree with your statement regarding x- rays and decay a spot on the tooth itself could be stain  decay  or from an existing silver filling this also should be brought to the attention of your dentist

7108,i i applaud your desire to have information before you arrive to the appointment a few questions would be helpful did you ever have symptoms in the past? any involvement of your eyes? was the positive csf oligoclonal bands or elevated igg index? the information you presented best fits with a monsymptomatic presentation as defined by the mcdonald's criteria which was designed to define those individuals who are likely to develop ms to secure the diagnosis you would need another clinical event or a change in your mri after 3 months they will probably want further testing including veps (visual evoked potentials) or oct (optical coherence tomography) the lab evaluation will include an ana  b12  folate  esr  vitamin d panel and routine labs they may also want a mri of the thoracic spine if the exam suggests spinal cord involvement good luck and well wishes
7109,common that said  all surgeries are different  depending on the severity and type of impact ions also the patients age  health  etc make huge difference some post ops are much worse than others discuss your situation w your surgeon during your consult!
7110,your your tooth most likely became infected because it has decay the decay slowly destroyed your tooth to the point where the nerve inside the tooth was exposed and eventually died the bacteria in the decay is now traveling through your tooth  into the bone  causing the infection you may also have the infection from gum disease  where the bone shrinks away over time  leaving a space between the gum and the bone called a pocket in this pocket bacteria can harden into calculus which can also be the cause of the infection your dentist gave you the antibiotics to take care of your symptoms (the infection)  but the antibiotics cannot fix the hole in your tooth or the bone loss if that is your problem those problems are still there no matter how many antibiotics you take  and will return after you stop the antibiotics you need to have the tooth extracted to resolve the problem try to have it done sooner than later to keep your condition from getting worse
7111,yes an impacted wisdom tooth does not always follow any certain schedule when it decides it wants to try to erupt into the mouth or cause problems if the area is sore  you should have an evaluation by a surgeon to determine if it is indicated for removal or if you should leave it
7112,very much so greetings from waco sorry to hear your cancer relapsed if there is any consolation  know that the fact it took so long to come back suggests it should respond well to therapy (i'm assuming it is er positive) also  know that cancer treatment has definitely improved and continues to do so fight well and best to you
7113,what is this cranber at times eczema or chronic fungal infection does not have any symptoms can try topical corticosteroids and anti-fungal creams twice day for 1 week  if not better need to see dermatologist for biopsy/culture watch for streaks/heat/pain that are signs of infection that need to be treated right away
7114,safe procedure if an appropriate clinical and radiographic evaluation has indicated that re-treatment is not an option and no other periodontal or anatomical factors are compromising the outcome  the risk factors are low for a competent endodontist or oral surgeon to successfully surgically treat the tooth professional literature supports the concept of retention of natural teeth over extraction
7115,it can lung transplant for cf is an important life prolonging therapy but it exchanges one set of problems for another after transplant  there is risk of rejection of the transplanted lungs by one's own immune system requiring use of strong meds that suppress your immune system which then increases your risk of serious infections there are many facets to this - talk to your cf dr to discuss pros/cons
7116,usually quick 20 - 30 minutes for routine uncomplicated breast implant removal
7117,no! no! very simply  the chance of you doing any good by popping the abcess is far outweighed by the possibility of you doing damage the fact that it has been drained and still fills up indicates that the source of the infection has not been resolved and your active infection needs immediate attention by you dentist put down the needle and pick up the telephone!
7118,i i think it is more likely that you are having persistent eustachian tube dysfunction the tubes help equalize the pressure in the middle ears when you are landing  the pressure in the middle ear is lower than the surrounding pressure  and that actually pulls (sucks) the eustachian tubes closed and equalization is harder persistent inflammation can make this last for weeks occasioanlly nasl steroids  antihistamines (if worsened by allergy)  decongestants can help--mostly just a matter of time if it is not getting better after 4-6 weeks or if it gets worse  see a doctor a hole in the ear drum is possible  but usually peopl complain of pressure and severe pain  followed by a pop/rupture and the pai lessens this could also cause some hearing loss most of these also resolve on their own
7119,the the best thing you can do is get a copy of your x-rays before the crown was done and get a second opinion of what is going on they might still get a new x-ray to compare with the old one best of luck

7121,if you have a stable physical finding since 2007  it is highly unlikely that it is cancer at your age  if imaging is indicated  ultrasound would be the modality of first choice  and then possibly a mammo depending on what it showed unless you are at very high risk(eg a brca carrier)  you don't need to start screening until you are 40
7122,if if you are sure you are swollen  then have it checked out to whom you go is a personal decision however  sometimes after cleanings your gums just feel a little swollen but are not actually swollen if you have any doubt or concern  by all means have it looked at
7123,lymphedema if a person has had surgery in the axilla to check for lymph nodes  they can be at risk for lymphedema or arm swelling this surgery disrupts the passage way for fluid to drain from the arm which then causes swelling thankfully  lymphedema from breast surgery is not a profound as it once was since less lymph nodes are removed
7124,yes ?implant ?tummy the option of breast reconstruction is always available for majority of patients undergoing cancer treatment if the longterm radiation effect on the tissues is limited and you don't require expansion then a one stage implant breast mound reconstruction is still possible but commonly an autogenous tissue reconstruction is required if radiation damage is more severe be sure to get brca gene tested
7125,since since you posted this question five days ago  you've probably addressed this issue by now naturally  a fever in someone who's got a kidney stone -- whether it's in the bladder or still in the ureter -- raises the question of a urinary tract infection if you're already taking an antibiotic  this is something that can wait until you can call your doctor unless you're developing other worrisome symptoms alternatively  if you spent two days in the hospital  your fever may simply be due to pulmonary atelectasis  a condition that results from prolonged bed rest when you're immobilized  small areas of your lungs become compressed  and this triggers a low-grade fever taking frequent deep breaths and moving about is usually all it takes to deal with atelectasis at any rate  i hope things have settled down and you're now feeling better
7126,no any unusual  outside force will influence your child's facial development facial growth in the presence of a sucking habit can lead to narrow upper jaw with crossbites and a long lower face the airway is also affected and will not develop properly  these kids generally breath through their mouth thumb  pacifier sucking is mostly for momwork out a plan to remove the sucking habit asap
7127,three three months is too short to get arthritis and well within the normal recovery period if you could move the finger well after the injury  chances are that everything's fine and you just need more time to be sure you need to be evaluated by a hand surgeon most people i meet that have a problem like yours are healing well  but the pain is making them protective  which actually slows their recovery recovery can be quite counterintuitive it helps to get the advice and reassurance of a hand surgeon
7128,sciatica your symptoms are descriptive of mild sciatic nerve compression  most cases resolve in several months in complaints similar to you
7129,it depends it really depends on the severity of the arthritis bracing and injectable lubricants may be helpful
7130,zev zev is correct-heat on your face is bad-it can draw the infection out toward the outside of your face if you have any concern about the progress of your healing call your dentist for an emergency look-see
7131,incomplete ? if you have hard swelling  you need to go to the er now if not hard  see the oral surgeon tomorrow am go get this checked out
7132,this this could indicate a cracked tooth  especially if it had a root canal unfortunately this is one of the hardest problems to diagnose i would recommend an evaluation by an endodontist a new technology called cbt (cone beam x-ray) is showing some promise in finding cracked teeth you may just have to let the situation declare itself more before acting with insufficient evidence of what is truly wrong as it may lead to unnecessary treatment
7133,neti neti pots will relieve sinus pressure if performed properly  but they can cause problems if you truly have a sinus infection  as opposed to seasonal sinusitis  you need to see your physician for a diagnosis and possibly antibiotic treatment
7134,the the calluses should not cause pain there are multiple possible causes for this type of foot pain i cannot tell from the nature of your pain and its location what the cause is some treatments are very simple including that for porokeratosis which may look like a callus but be painful i advise you to always wear a shoe or good soled slipper when walking even around your house see a podiatrist for a clear diagnosis the pain is not normal and it may not be related to the diabetes
7135,yes you should be able to return to sports when fully recovered
7136,possible tmj could be tension headaches associated tmj recommend you consult your dentist
7137,see your doc! if your foot feels like it is cold and you have a calf that hurts you want to definitely have it checked out i would definitely see your doc or if you are having any shortness of breath  chest pain  calf swelling  you need to go to the er to get it checked out but i would call the physician on call if the office is closed and tell them your foot shouldn't be cold  and you shouldn't have numbnes

7140,more information your symptoms are fairly non-specific and this could represent any number of things make an appointment with your primary medical doctor to get a diagnosis and treatment
7141,need radiation tx as a patient you have the right to refuse any therapy as long as you are aware of the consequencies of your decision now  radiation therapy will be needed if you only had a lumpectomy- to reduce your recurrence risk to the same breast that is for your own benefit you are young which means your risk for cancer recurrence will be quite significant- so you want to reduce it as much as possible
7142,why why do you think you have a brain tumor? which doctors have you seen ?
7143,keep looking you symptoms are complex and many keep working with your doctors to find a cause there may be multiple reasons for your symptoms
7144,oncologist you need to work with an oncologist to determine the treatment options there is nothing you can do without treatment other than comfort and nutrition
7145,in addition    xanax and valerian root may synergistically increase cns and respiratory depression
7146,effects of change sometimes when antidepressant medication is started or changed it can heighten symptoms or change severity of symptoms sometimes symptoms settle down and go away within a couple of weeks no matter what discuss side effects and the way medication effects you with prescribing doctor
7147,see detailed answer it is normal to bleed lightly in your case for upto 4 weeks please follow up on your hcg with your doctor atleast once a week until the levels drop completely to a non pregnant level which is less than 5 or 0
7148,fever &amp; ear infectio high fever & irritability after full 72 hours of amoxil means either the bacterial infection is resistant to amoxil or a viral infection  he needs a f/u appt with his pediatrician asap continue treatment   control fever & keep him hydrated at the mean time i hope he gets better soon  good l
7149,uncertain your question does not appear complete as printed here please restate the question for a potential answer
7150,could be it certaiy could be if it doesn't resolve in the next several says  get it checked
7151,depends a hernia is a defect in the facial layer of the abdominal wall if the defect is there  then you have a hernia if the fascia is weak  of course it is more prone to pulling apart than normal fascia one of the concepts of hernia repair with mesh is that the mesh can bridge any gap in the fascia by selecting the right size mesh
7152,it shouldnt a hydrocelectomy is a relatively benign and common procedure that is performed as an outpatient surgery it should not affect your functioning long term risks of surgery include bleeding  infection  and damage to structures nearby the testicle
7153,rectal bleeding at 26  it's unlikely you have cancer  but it's not impossible there are many possible causes of bleeding  hemorrhoids being the most common at your age to answer your question - cancer could bleed then stop  but it's not the most common behavior of them you should see your doctor for a check up and to be reassured if your doc thinks you need a colonoscopy  get one to be sure you are ok
7154,strep tonsillitis ? he needs to be seen to have the right dx and rx strep throat has exudate  swollen glands  headache  chills and bodyaches and can cause heart problem if neglected
7155,no need recent research demonstrated that antibiotics are of no benefit in treating symptoms after root canal treatment take nsaids otc or tylenol for swelling and pain control
7156,nothing special the recovery period is usually unremarkable the first few days the patient may require some soft diet due to discomfort with swallowing liquids should be tepid rather than too hot or cold there may be some visible coating in the beds where tonsills used to be he may need to take some ibuprofen to help reduce the postoperative pain and inflammation
7157,laminectomy you are still relatively fresh post op  some of my patients take longer to recover sometimes 6 to 12 months before things are better check with your surgeon to make sure there are no issues that need addressing if not  be patient  ask for a sleeping pill to make you more comfortable
7158,knee pain please check the answers to all the similar questions you asked obviously max out on conservative before tka
7159,difficult to say this is considered an advanced cancer  stage iv or distant metastases stage as you said  surgery and radiation is the treatment for this however  as to the outcome  it is difficult to say the 5 year survival of patients with this stage is <5%  but with just one lesion  and all the advances you never know  so see your doctor/oncologist best of luck
7160,viral infection from the sparse details given  i can reasonably conclude you are suffering from a viral infection (common at this time of year) ear aches and accompanied swollen lymph nodes in the neck area are not uncommon if you start to have a significant fever  an md consult would be of benefit
7161,see an ent asap while it could be minor vitamin b12 deficiency  it could also be a much more serious condition  you need to see a md or ent asap
7162,need more info any fever? have you started any new medications? are you sleeping well? have your blood cell count  liver and kidney and thyroid function checked by a simple blood test   for additional clues
7163,be seen there are several options  you should discuss them with your physician
7164,let's back up there may be several things going on simultaneously  and may be related or purely coincidental yes ear infections can be associated with referred pain in the area is it truly tooth type pain (acute to hot and cold and pressure)? teeth are not found on the jaw line unless severely impacted  if so it was significant surgery if fairly recently done  see dentist asap  otherwise ent consult
7165,call the center you will need a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound which are scheduled separate at most centers from screening mammogram the center will be able to make an appointment for you though you do need an order from your primary doc and the center may be able to facilitate obtaining that paperwork
7166,strain yes it is possible but it could be abdominal strain if you have a hernia see a surgeon and they will fix it
7167,not normal you should see your doctor for a pregnancy test and pelvic exam what contraception are you using now?
7168,yes could be a number of things causing your sore jaw among them are clenching/grinding your teeth  abscessed tooth  etc best to consult with your dentist
7169,neurologist  mri first  don't panic uneven pupils  aka anisocoria  are often due to a benign condition like migraines which would also explain the eye pain and headaches however  more serious causes like multiple sclerosis and brain tumors are possible you should see a neurologist who will likely order an mri of the brain as part of a complete evaluation
7170,does it feel like gb does it feel like your old gallbladder attacks? it is possible to have issues such as retained stones or even new primary gallstones formed in your bile ducts after gallbladder removal nausea? bloating? belching? other causes are simple pulled muscle or rib issues internal causes include liver  pancreas  stomach  colon etc see your doctor for history and physical
7171,see your dds & md tmj problems only get worse if not treated see your dentist for an evaluation and treatment plan your dentist may refer you to a physician (possibly a dermotologist) to evaluate the growth - they may biopsy the growth
7172,yes in fact  that is exactly what some women do before starting pre-operative chemotherapy first  they have their sentinel node biopsy  then they have their chemotherapy and finally they have their surgery  either lumpectomy or mastectomy
7173,no good answer even mastectomy does not preclude previous circulating microscopic cells the body has natural killer immune cells that hopefully can eradicate these small amounts of cancer cells given other appropriate therapies
7174,yes chronic sinusitis can present in a multitude of ways including congestion and blockage in the absence of discharge the clincher would be a decrease in your sense of smell and taste
7175,get it checked i suggest that you get it checked out although  this may be a minor thing  like patella tendinitis (inflammation of one of the tendons that hold the knee cap in place)  more serious causes may also occur you may be referred to physical therapy if your exam/xray are negative
7176,trismus there is no such thing as classic tmj  the same as there is no classic knee they both are anatomic names of joints more likely it is the transitory inflammation of the muscles of biting and opening (masseteric sling)  named trismus limit opening wide  ice on and off  take nsaid (advil etc)  moist heat  soft diet; then it very well may subside good luck!
7177,yes a significant number of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have negative blood tests but still have the disease the history  physical examination  x-rays  and other blood tests may verify the disease lupus with negative blood tests is rare
7178,cervical spondylosis cervical spondylosis or degenerative changes in the cervical spine could account for all of your symptoms if the numbness has been present for more than a few weeks  i would suggest being seen by your primary care physician x-rays may be indicated depending on the results of your initial examination
7179,unproven the theraputic options you have choosen are un proven they are not helping and potentially making things worse go to your dr and get evaluation done with fda treatment
7180,new technology the state of the art of dental imaging is a cone beam ct a low dose 3d image the hospital does not have that technology probably twice we diagnoses fractures that the er missed the panoramic x-ray was the best they had i guess
7181,not distinguishing flat vs raised does not distinguish between melanomas and benign moles other characteristics  like asymmetry  border irregularity  unusual or changing color  and size changes  are much more commonly associated with melanoma
7182,tmj sounds like tmj syndrome to me very often tmj patients suffer from tinnitus ear ringing anatomically the joint is very close to the ear canal sea payed by a very thin piece of bone so often people who have tmj issues also have ear symptoms as well need to get a comprehensive dental exam with someone trained in this area you can google the pankey institute and fine a dentist in your area
7183,abcd's remember your abcd's when thinking of melanoma look for moles with asymmetry boarders that are irregular color differences within the same mole diameter greater than 6mm also any new mole or old that starts to itch  bleed or ulcerate should be of concern another rule is the ugly duckling rule which refers to a mole that looks distantly different from the others on your body
7184,focal nerve damage while compression of the nerve roots is certainly a very common cause for nerve damage  there is a long list of other causes that need to be investigated  including inherited neuropathies  lumbosacral plexitis  vasculitis  and masses in the pelvis or thigh i would strongly recommend seeing a neurologist with experience in neuromuscular disease to narrow down the problem and start treatment
7185,sounds like you are getting a viral infection cold? flu? take it easy  rest  lots of fluids tylenol for aches & fever or nyquil (will make you sleepy) you're probably contagious so try not to expose others cover your cough wash hands often try gargling w 1 tbsp salt dissolved in warm water chicken soup (seriously) hot lemonade w honey can be soothing i love thai soup when i feel like this
7186,his pediatrician  a pediatric pulmonologist or ent can order an overnight sleep study or oximetry at home both drops in oxygen during sleep & iron deficiency can cause developmental delays limit milk & milk products to 16-21 oz/day & re-check labs after a month on iron supplements use the developmental screens on firstsignsorg or call your state health division's early intervention program for assessment
7187,depends could be a few things  at the top of my differential includes kidney stones and cystic kidney disease with the first be more likely you need some imaging most likely ultrasound or ct scan
7188,unlikely a urine pregnancy test should be positive if you conceived with an iui cycle- 14 days after the iui make sure you are using a name brand kit and followed the instructions to increase accuracy sorry! :( if you are not sure about the urine test call your doctor to have a blood pregnancy test done if your period has not started
7189,check with surgeon check with your surgeon generally  if your having instability it is usually one of two things: your acl is not working properly  or  you may be having instability from a kneecap tracking problem
7190,see your doctor it would be best to check with your ob
7191,chronic sinusitis greetings all good questions for a troubling case like yours have you been immune tested? if not  consider this balloon sinuplasty may be of benefit to open and drain infected frontal sinuses finally a aggressive maintenance program is needed
7192,hard to know mole-removing creams are generally not approved by the fda  and are herbal or naturally derived these have not been rigorously tested and can have significant side effects in the short term and long term i would advise seeing a dermatologist if it looks ok  you probably don't need to remove it at all!
7193,as above it could be what u doctor told u  to find out they usually can do a biopsy  try to see a dermatologist for evaluation and work up
7194,melanoma in general pathologists do an excellent job with an entire specimen please have it re-excised with an adequate margin if there is concern over the scar please see a board certified plastic surgeon for a consult regarding this issue the majority i my practice is devoted to the care of cancer patient and i will be sent patients frequently for consults of this nature and other reconstructive needs
7195,compression rest  elevate leg and compression hose help with swelling make sure you have been evaluated for a blood clot if swelling persists that is life threatening make sure you have follow up w primary care soon
7196,poor venous return theer is only one way out for the blood in your leg the back of the knee   a little knee swelling slows the way out for blood so it backs up rot he lowest point your foot if you have a acewrap on loosen it and elevate your leg above your heart stay horizontal
7197,difficult since it is difficult to tell  i always recommend checking the heart out first  since the consequences if missing cardiac disease can be fatal also  hiatal hernias that mimic cardiac disease are large if this turns out to be the case  seek a consultation with a general or thoracic surgeon experienced with laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair
7198,see a hand surgeon see a hand surgeon as you may have raynaud's and the lump is likely due to cyst called a ganglion you may need work up to rule out causes of sympathetic overactivity you have answered two questions already with the information you provided ie your age and that you don't smoke
7199,no connection tmj is not connected to the salivary gland it is probably a coincidence
7200,don't worry though there is a very small increased risk of certain cancers associated with radiation  the risk is much higher in young children who have multiple ct scans brain tumors are rare and the absolute risk for an adult who has had one or a few head cts is only very slightly higher than those who do not have head ct scans the risk is still very low and should not cause you any anxiety or fear
7201,breast cyst if it is completely a simple cyst without septation or nodularity then it does not need aspiration and following up with repeat sonography is fine
7202,not likely a fractur a fracture is highly likely to be painful keep an eye on the red bump to make sure it is going away over days and not enlarging
7203,probably not it is more likely that your child came down with another infection  commonly viral one if amoxicillin did not work  ear pain and fever should have persisted
7204,show your derm any mole that is changing or begins to itch  bleed or ulcerate should be brought to the attention of your friendly dermatologist
7205,permanent procedure if a permanent removal procedure such as matrixectomy or a phenol and alcohol procedure is performed appropriately the recurrence rate is relatively low
7206,see doctor at your age probably not but any change in bowel caliber warrants consideration of a colonoscopy you should really discuss in more detail with your doctor
7207,only after anal sex most common cause of getting a bacterial urinary infection is bacteria from around the urethral or vaginal opening moving up the urthra by the pumping action within vagina situated just under the ur increaseethra uti can be avoided by emptying bladder after sex changing positions during vaginal sex does not increase vaginal infections or utis
7208,i'm not exactly sure what the question is asking is there an enlarging breast lump? it needs to be evaluated by your doctor was it only seen on the 2009 mammo? was there any follow-up?
7209,more info needed did you get a head ct or mri when you were in the hospital? if these symptoms are new or if they are getting worse compared to when you were in the hospital  yes go back if any of the following: headache is constant  associated with nausea  vomiting  gets worse when you bend down  strain  cough or sneeze  go to the er immediately if you are not sure  err on the safe side and go back for checkup
7210,quick energy creatine is a quick energy source for the muscle  esp helpful for short bursts exercises like a sprint but recent studies suggest that in endurance exercises it can help in weight gain and muscle building by decreasing utilization of glycogen and protein in the muscle fiber  in short you use creatine instead of muscle protein hence greater muscle mass
7211,this could help with migraine (if it was in fact a migraine)  an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure  as they say for now  getting some sleep  avoiding bright lights  loud sounds  nsaids may help  but if you're a migraine sufferer i think it's worth it to try to find your triggering factors (eg  food allergies) and then having a method to stave them off asap  rx or otherwise
7212,buck up  jellybelly it sounds almost like you'd be happier if you did have a tumor you've had mris & cts and they showed no tumors you need to let go of the headache = tumor obsession & take control of your life & your headaches instead of playing the victim & letting them control you go to a doctor & start getting these everyday thangs under control instead of just being scare & going poor  poor  pitiful me
7213,headache and zoloft headaches are possible side effects of both zoloft and trazodone usually  they go away with time as you take the medication in some cases they do not  so it is very important to let your doctor know about the headaches if the headache gets worse or you begin to have other symptoms such as confusion or dizziness  contact your doctor right away to let him/her know
7214,academic training it is accepted it is team building and foundation of surgical training younger surgeons are involved in every detail of your case and are often a big advantage however  it is understandable to be surprised  especially if discussion about how this training occurs was minimized many patients ask  are you the surgeon? that is cue to talk about the team and how it works to benefit patient
7215,agree you are best hope is to do a yearly mammogram foe early detection the radiation dose is minimal
7216,positive test pregnancy hormone rises during the first several weeks of pregnancy  peaking around 10 weeks at 100  000  give or take so  all this test presently shows is that you are pregnant from the level alone  you cannot say anything regarding gestational age
7217,see answer have your dr carefully evaluate you after plain radiographs an mri might be an appropriate diagnostic exam but not a pet scan
7218,see below usually pimples are not std
7219,probably ok you are probably ok if you see a bulge around your incision  or if the pain doesnt go away   go back and see your surgeon
7220,healing hard to say from your question description could be a hypertrophic scar could be normal healing that will settle down with time and massage if your vulva or labia minora are pulled from the biopsy  you may need a skin graft to allow it to relax back into normal position again  impossible to know without examining you
7221,perhaps not if a rather invasive extraction of a lower third molar  it may be reaching the end of a normal healing/pain cycle if it was a routine extraction it is possible that the clot was dislodged and a dry socket is causing you significant pain also  if iv sedation was used  it is sometimes found that over-stretching of your jaw muscles may have caused temporary inflammation of the jaw joint(s)
7222,plica consider scar  synovitis  new tears of meniscal tissues  patellar maltracking  continued plica impingement check with your orthopedic surgeon
7223,could be you should alert your dermatologist to any changes in your existing moles it is time to see your dermatologist

7227,many possibilities being overweight  out of shape  or wearing shoes with the wrong type of support for your feet  size and activity level are common reasons @ 20 being unbalanced because of mild scoliosis or bone length differences is not unusual things that make joints hurt from swelling(from a little to a lot) include thyroid disease  drugs/supplements  lyme disease  rheumatoid arthritis & more best to see md
7228,skin eruptions/bumps thank you for your question tiny bumps on the head & neck in a newborn may be caused by many things (including acne) there are forms of inflammatory conditions of the skin that could cause a rash as well as responses to external & internal sources or otherwise having an examination and evaluation performed by a qualified medical practitioner would be helpful in accurate diagnosis & treatment
7229,agree that probably okkeep well hydrated & follow closely with your physician
7230,tmj swollen lymph nodes are not associated with tmj they are associated with the immune system they can be swollen due to bacterial infections  viral infections  and on rare occasions cancer please see your md for a diagnosis
7231,dont outrule teeth although a headache and dizzyness can be caused by a number of things (non-dental)  dont rule out the dentures as a possible cause if you feel like the symptoms are related to when wearing your dentures  they very well may be contributing to your pain getting an evaluation will help to see if there are any tmj joint changes or issues with the dentures that are putting undue stress on your jaws
7232,polypharmacy alert! you need to check the spelling of medications you use; learn both the trade name and the generic versions a pharmacy dispensed clomiphene to my patient instead of what was prescribed  clomipramine  it went undetected for three months her ovaries were 3x normal size  hormones were off the chart and she thought she was going insane! remember kiss? serotonin syndrome is a serious risk! google it!

7456,no difference the appearance of a scar is less dependent on the lesion that was removed  than the location on the body or face of the lesion  and the skill of the plastic surgeon who removed it hopefully  under favorable circumstances  such a scar can heal almost invisibly

7476,amoxicillin that was the originally accepted pre-medication dosage for patients who need to take antibiotic prior to dental procedures for whatever the reason  prosthetic hip or knees  organic heart murmurs  but the cardiologists  and orthopedists have backed off on the need for antibiotic pre-medication to prevent infection or endocarditis in many instances that routinely required the medication before

7483,it may be too early in addition to above answer  there are other factors infection go through stages first  the toxins released by the bacteria and dead tissue cause inflammation which is associated with tissue swelling and pain there is nothing to drain then as more white blood cells migrate to the infection some will die along with your tissue causing cavitation filled with pus  & that is the time to drain it
7484,additional studies these studies suggest that your plasma cells are producing too much gamma globulin additional studies and physical examination by a hematologist is good advice
7485,no i'm not sure if i understand correctly (whether there was a typo) but an l4 lumbar nerve issue should not have any bearing on neck symptoms to clarify however - what is the thecal sac lesion?
7486,go to local county hospital  they likely will treat you for free if indigent

7490,weeks if it is an allergy take your medicine like zyrtec check pollen count in your area from pollencom shower after going outside and change your bed linens if persists see your primary care doctor

7506,very unlikely for a 25 year old  colon cancer is unusual most likely the symptoms are due to a different cause it is important for your physician to perform a history/physical exam and help you figure out what might be going on it is too difficult to give a diagnosis online without a proper evaluation

7677,contraception used? if contraception was used  then your period is simply delayed if not  see your obgyn md to rule out pregnancy
7678,absolutely not the need for surgery depends on the degree of impingement and compression on the nerve roots most neurologists and neurosurgeons recommend surgery in the setting of motor impairment (weakness)  severe pain or debilitating numbness  or exam or nerve conduction study findings suggesting progression of the process work with your doctor  physical therapist  and pain management first
7679,cancer in mouth most oral cancers are painless  which make them more challenging to find may be a viral infection causing swellings and inflammation could be mononucleosis
7680,well yes it is true  but permanent is rare
7681,delay period? no there is no way to delay your period as you described i do wish you the best!
7682,global decline frustrating situation more information about prior test and examinations will be helpful however evaluating for systemic autoimmune/vascular conditions  chronic infectious process and brain demyelinating and degenerating conditions major depression though a consideration dose not cause fever
7683,needs evaluation your problem needs physical evaluation  not internet guesses why are you procrastinating? call a local dentist to start the process
7684,get help are you serious? or are you depressed  frustrated  or exhausted? your plan of action will likely hurt your liver and likely provide an additive sedative effect  but may actually activate seizure activity rather than designing your own sleep cocktail  would strongly urge discussion with your doctor  and even get an overnight sleep study do not mix all this stuff  risk is sky high!!!
7685,no eating do not eat before your surgery if you are planning on having sedatin for your surgery you cannot eat your oral surgeon or dentist should have given you directions if you are not npbwing sedated then a very light meal is ok 
7686,sensitivity to cold sensitivity to cold is much less serious than sensitive to hot many times this will go away without treatment  does your bite feel normal?
7687,absolutely this is actually a very common reason for swelling of neck nodes along with sore throats depending on the extent of the infection  you could have either anterior (front) or posterior (back) nodes in the cervical region enlarge this is actually a good response by your immune system they wil go back to normal in 1-8 weeks after the infection has been cleared
7688,infection assuming the throat infection is bacterial and from the tooth and your doctor prescribed the appropriate antibiotic regimen  the infection should begin to resolve within a couple of days however  i hope your are also receiving the necessary dental treatment to address the tooth infection antibiotics alone will not eliminate the cause of the dental infection
7689,low chance but not zero low chance but not zero
7690,well being that your only 30 it's unlikely but not impossible if you are a smoker  overweight  have high cholesterol or high blood pressure and if heart disease runs in the family (first degree relative with a heart attack 55 or younger) go see a dr and get and ecg you might still be having a heart attack and take a 325mg aspirin or 4x 81 mg just for good measure won't harm you either way
7691,allergic reaction? sounds like an allergic reaction to something? i'm not sure a&d will help much i would try some benedryl instead if the swelling worsens or you have trouble breathing you need to go to an urgent care or er right away
7692,apply pressure place a wad of gauze over the gum and bite down to apply pressure to the area for at least 30 minutes
7693,see dentist you may have an infection
7694,possibly unfortunately there is no really good way to tell without being examined herpes usually causes painful sores but can itch you should try to see your doctor fairly soon because a herpes culture is more accurate in the first few days of an outbreak
7695,yes the colonoscopy can fully evaluate the colon  including whether any diverticulosis is present
7696,various possibilitie wart  cyst  even a skin cancer without an actual examination  i cannot give specific medical advice on your particular health and dermatologic conditions are particularly hard to evaluate without seeing them in person big big point though: every single cause mentioned treatable
7697,wait for ct before making any other treatment plans
7698,nope if u have pain then its not healed  at least not properly  
7699,office visit i recommend that you see you own physician for a complete and thorough exam and evaluation you should also see your own dentist for an exam and x-rays together they should be able to resolve these issues when was you last medical and dental check-up?
7700,no so long as you don't smoke anymore before they're born smoking anything is bad and potentially even worse during the first trimester you should be taking extra extra care not to ingest or do things to your body at least for the first 13 weeks if not your entire pregnancy to prevent complications and difficulties for which your child cannot control and may not be able to do much about later in life
7701,probably not lyrica tends to be better tolerated than neurontin if you have concerns  contact your prescribing physician
7702,highly unlikely i'd say it is almost impossible nevertheless  you should still be practicing safe sex

7704,no other infraclavicular lesion is essentially lymph node in origin while axillary nodes attain 3 levels of spread  only level 1 palpable  any node noted in infrac;lavicular region is likely rotters node  an interpectoral node that is usually breast in origin but can spread from cutaneous lesions tumors spreading from abdomen/ pelvis usually go to virchows node in the l supraclavicular region
7705,dr lewis correct gargle don't haggle! caffeine free tea available everywhere until you go to store  warm water a bit of lemon and a healthy teaspoon of honey should suffice short term best of luck!

7707,depends if your pregnancy test was negative at 4-5 past the due for your period  you are unlikely to be pregnant hormonal imbalance with anovulatory cycles can cause the symptoms you mentioned

7714,sleep study no  an eeg is not normally done for sleep disorders an eeg is done to evaluate epilepsy and seizure a sleep study is helpful for evaluating sleep disorders such as sleep apnea  parasomnia  insomnia and sometimes a special sleep study with eeg is done for people who have seizures during sleep your primary doc may be able to get a screening sleep study that you can have at home
7715,re-evaluation how long ago was your last check up? even if it was last week  something is different today to cause that swelling a trapped food particle? a loose filling? a piece of calculus? an undetected problem? have your dentist take a look
7716,unprotected sex you should consider several things: first get a pregnancy test  second  truly consider the use of birth control pills and lastly  have your sexual partner use condoms unprotected sex will ultimately get you prgenant and if you are old enough to have frequent intercourse  then you are old enough for birth control- be responsible
7717,unknown you probably are not pregnant  but even if you had not missed a pill  even using the pill 100% perfectly can still fail many women have become pregnant even when using contraception as prescribed my suggestion is using a home pregnancy test if it is positive then you have your answer if negative  you may still want to check in with your doctor keep using your pills unless you have a + test
7718,see allergist unless you have been tested  you cannot rule out allergies yet burning eyes is not typical for allergic conjunctivitis and more suggestive of dry eyes or an irritant reaction to eye cosmetics (mascara) and even infection vasomotor rhinitis is yet another possibility suggest that you consult an allergist
7719,pregnant? what you described simulates symptoms of pregnancy  but obtain a serum test from your healthcare professional  and it will be decisive then see your healthcare professional for advice and treatment

7725,why? if there is no infection in sinus you may want to get your throat and ear infection treated instead and not to worry about sinus drainage

7745,35 ml tylenol or acetaminophen now comes only in one strength for its liquid preperations i e 160mg/5ml to avoid potential over dosage due to more concentrated tylenol infants drops until recent past the dose charts are generally included on packages for older children but a rough guidefor safe dosing is ~10 mg/kg per dose given on bottles
7746,need information those are symptoms that need to be addressed there just isnt enough information i would want lab tests  such as thyroid  and sugar testing stomach tests such as upper gi and gallbladder test  your physical exam should also reveal more pcos would lend itself to endocrine problems  such as sugar and thyroid  weight gain  hair growth and is very common  1 in 20 women
7747,sounds like hfmd u just have to wait it out it will go away on it's own if she has oral lesions that r causing trouble eating or drink u could ask the doctor to prescribe magic mouth was for the pain
7748,maybe those can be similar to symptoms of depression  low t  menopause  and many people who simply live in america  dont take time to eat well  sleep well  and exercise regularly if these symptoms persist  may see endocrinologist for more uncommon causes  but also if there is room for improvement in lifestyle  try to make consistent changes even though you dont feel like it  for at least a month
7749,pricems for any acute musculoskeletal injury  initial treatment is pricems: pressure  rest  ice  compressive wraps  elevation  medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications) if you have increased tenderness in the ankle and foot  with increasing pain out of proportion  compartment syndrome is a concern  which need immediate attention to prevent future complications
7750,hit head well if you didn't lose consciousness  you have no change in your vision  you have no nausea or vomiting  no numbness or tingling  you are speaking well to others then it is very unlikely that you have a significant injury if these things change or when you push on your skull where you hit your skull moves then you need to be seen
7751,nooo nokimbersure is a común viral infection
7752,not then  but please protect yourself sexuality requires responsibility and maturity  or you will get hurt when you start being intimate  it can be painfully difficult to stop remember it is your body  and you have a lot more at risk (unwanted pregnancy  social stigma  anxiety  other mental health issues  infections  stds) than your boyfriend does see your doctor about risks and sexual safety keep safe

7756,call doc the good news- likely nothing serious cancer extremely unlikely the bad news- you are still suffering it appears that you likely have asthma do note that advair takes 2-3 weeks to provide optimal benefits you should call your doctor if the answer does not satisfy you consider consulting an allergist
7757,duration and change skin issues common  male breast unusual it used to be exclusively older men  but camp lejeune cluster in marines  family and vets suggest environmental toxin if the lump has been there and has not changed  i'd worry less if it is enlarging  red  and painful  see a surgeon cancer usually is not painful  but it needs removal and sent to path to analyze
7758,see a doctor your symptoms suggest infection - do not use otc medications until you have seen a doctor - go asap
7759,breast asymmetry breast asymmetry is common if it is very different from previous then a repeat in 6 month if nothing else is found if your breast is painful then have your doctor check them breast congestion can cause pain hot compresses can help open up the ducts and relieve the congestion an exam by your doctor will clarify what may be doing on

7762,unlikely the internet is dangerous place at times it gives people all this information but can't help them interpret the significance or insignificance of it at your age cancer is way way down on the list of possibilities for your symptoms you probably just have a benign little lymph node but your anxiety has spiraled you into a whole list of other symptoms go to your doctor  and get your life back
7763,very doubtful the detergent is very unlikely the cause keep yourself meticulously clean and if problems persist a doctor can look for infection rarely recurrent problems might be addressed with a circumcision

7766,tmjoint this is related to a dislocation of your temporomandibular joint(s) apply moist heat to the outside of your face just opposite your jaw joint  use advil  motrin or aleve if you can take them  and stick on a soft diet for awhile even if this improves quickly  have your tmjoints and occlusion evaluated by a dentist to determine if this was just a quirk or a precursor to a chronic condition
7767,signs of arthritis what you relate are signs of arthritis radiographically speaking i'd've expected this type of picture more from an older person or one who suffered a significant injury to that area of the back or has been doing extensive repetitive bending & similar work for years if you were to modify what you do with your back you could slow this down if not  then  unfortunately  yes  it could progress
7768,coughing forceful coughing will often cause blood vessels to rupture in areas such as your eyes have her assessed for causes of her coughing a cxr can often be normal despite an underlying illness  such as whooping cough or asthma continue to search for the cause of her coughing

7770,anovulatory it is normal to have a gap in periods while breastfeeding full time this can continue as long as you breastfeed! we call it lactation amenorrhea it's also normal to cramp while you breastfeed the oxytocin released during letdown will cause this congrats on breastfeeding your baby! she is going to be so healthy!
7771,chest pain atypical chest pain is difficult to deal with at times i see you have had an ekg and i assume it was normal although you may not be having acute coronary syndrome  you may be having some type of pericariditis or pleurisy costochondritis or sternal wall pain the sharp pains could also be caused by intercostal irritation
7772,basically yes they are as safe for an 18 year old as they would be for an adult of more advanced age however  if you are cutting yourself every day this is not safe - there are a number of ways you can do yourself significant damage for self-harm  the premier treatment is psychotherapy  and there are a few specific kinds for this: dialectical behavior therapy & mentalization-based therapy are two examples
7773,yes a cta will be able to detect abnormal lung masses with fairly decent accuracy the test of choice would be a ct without contrast  however most radiologists can read through the added contrast material
7774,it could it definitely could if it persists more than a few days another cause is more likely hope you feel better
7775,ok this reading is ok  but maybe e a bit low depending upon why you are taking the meds should bring this up with doc especially if you get light headed when you stand quickly or when you take a hot shower
7776,maybe it could be part of the cause speak to a surgeon for more information
7777,warm compress apply warm towel 3-4 times daily if there is redness to the eye  or if the swelling does not get better  then see eye specialist right away
7778,yes and no if you were actively having an episode of say blurred vision or weakness  then yes if the mri is done at the time you have symptoms  it should be visible its unlikely though that your symptoms are due to ms  as they are not consistent with the disease migraine is more common  and also analgesic overuse  post-concussive  and occipital nerve related headache more likely lp is the definitive test
7779,prodrome certainly serious symptoms you may be in the earliest stages of shingles; however  see your physician for a complete exam and ct of head and neck for starters 
7780,may be a cold but since you have fever and chills you should see your physician to be checked for something that may need treatment
7781,not yet dense breasts often decrease the effectiveness of mammogram if there is any concern about the mammogram you could consider asking for an mri to be performed of the breasts- this may add additional information in helping to determine if there is anything to be concerned about

7783,pericornitis the gum around there has become infected it will need to be treated by having the wisdom tooth removed the doctor may prescribe antibiotics intially
7784,unlikely the semen has to meet the egg in a woman's fallopian tube via her uterus  cervix and vagina when the sperm/semen fertilizes the egg and that egg implants she is pregnant so unless you did something more where your penis come in contact with her vagina it is unlikely she will get pregnant
7785,tell them it is certainly a reasonable combination your pcp should be able to listen to your concerns and suggestions
7786,no lung cancer if chest x-ray is negative  then lung cancer less likely have you had a ct scan examination? your cough may be due to acid reflux if concerned do get a clinical checkup
7787,very like so as ibuprofen and aspirin fit under the nsaids(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)  so it isn't uncommon if you are allergic to aspirin to be allergic to motrin  ibuprofen  aleve  naprosen vicodin contains hydrocodone and acetaminphen  neither which usually cross react with the previously mentioned drugs but opioid containing drugs are not ideal for migraine management talk with your doc
7788,sounds like tm joint sounds like am imbalance in your tm (jaw)joints ask your dentist for a specialist in this disorder hope this helps dr z

7791,lesser of 2 evils not that i'm a great fan of xanax because of it's addictive potential  but in the grand scheme of things i'd probably advise you to not play with your medications like that if you're on xanax that regularly  you just shouldn't drink alcohol sorry

7793,yes try an over the counter pregnancy test or visit your primary care doctor for a preganancy evaluation
7794,nose probably viral but with the green phlegm  there is probably a bacterial component with your history of asthma  best to see your primary and decide if you need to be on antibiotics
7795,question sorry not clear on what the question is dont think it would interfere with intercourse
7796,cough there are several reasons to have a prolonged cough several infections will cause a cough most of these infections are viral so antibiotics don't help these coughs can last for several days to weeks after the infection also allergies symptoms can cause a cough severe gerd can cause a cough also malignancies can cause a cough  it would be unlikely probably need to be seen again by pcp
7797,gives some info endoscopy better
7798,asthma the shortness of breath and tight chest has me worried that you can be having an asthma attack you should get checked out  whether in an er setting or clinic feel better!!
7799,milky discharge? galactorrhoea is a condn associated with milky discharge from the breasts it is associated with excess of a hormone- prolactin   coming from pituitary gland  excess prolactin levels sometimes interfere with conception hence you need to check if it is from the excess hormone  the milky disch is what you have  with a ob & gyn doctor as you want to conceivesome medications can cause galactorhoea
7800,not migraine there are many causes of dizziness if there is a true spinning sensation it is called vertigo and usually is due to a disturbance of the vestibular part of the inner ear if it is more of a lightheadedness it's often due to anxiety or stress for a patient oriented discussion of this topic see: bitly/1yzi7rd at patientcouk website
7801,risk factors for chd concern is genuine been anxious and stressful won't help good you have negative tests the next important steps then is quit smoking if you do  exercise  at least 30-45 minutes of aerobic walking daily or 4x/week : diet close to mediterranean diet  no fatty foods  grilled  or broiled or baked should be the norm  less meat  more fish and chicken  adequate fluid intake blood pressure control
7802,see dr let your dr know you prefer not to simply take narcotic pain meds-which is a good request possibly a steroid taper can help reduce pain and inflammation physical therapy (all different modalities: massage  deep heat ultrasound  traction  aquatherapy  etc may help  possibly an epidural injection may help non narcotic nsaids may help follow-up for a good discussion with your doctor
7803,pericoronitis you might have an infection under that flap of tissue that has spread into the muscles impossible to say without an x-ray and exam get to a dentist asap
7804,consult oral surgeon i am sure you have consulted oral surgeon  md  ent  and sleep specialist good luck
7805,disk displacement? hard to say without a thorough history and exam cause  frequency and severity very important i would see a tmj/tmd specialist if you are locking (which sounds like you are- closed lock ) the disk may be dislocating do you have clicking and/or popping when opening and/or closing?
7806,sinus drainage sounds like your sinuses are draining down the back of your throat causing the sore throat and cough usually viral or allergic allergic is generally clear since green would treat with increased fluids  vitamin c and zinc  and appropriate rest if it persists   go to primary doc for antibiotic consideration
7807,sinusitis likely sinusitis see md for exam/xray/probable antibiotics
7808,see doctor and have him evaluated  try a cool mist vaporizer and saline nose spray in the meantime

7810,healing seems like a normal healing process  but if the discomfort continues i would see the dentist/oral surgeon hard to say without being the one who took out your teeth and knowing your complete health history
7811,see a doctor the best diagnostic technique for diagnosing a rash is seeing and sometimes feeling it with years of experience  doctors see many rashes from many different causes and good at diagnosing most rashes on sight proper diagnosis is key for making treatment recommendations the accompanying picture is of a classic appearing rash known as tinea corporsis scratching may cause the rash to spread
7812,infection you have an infection there are many possible causes possible fractured root failing root canal  abscess that won't heal without being removed etc! get to an endodontist asap!
7813,yes if the crack allows for bacteria to infect the root and/or gums then the lymph nodes draining that part of your mouth will react and enlarge
7814,two non-surgical assuming conservative means medications  physical therapy with modalities  meditation  etc   a visit to a pain clinic is warranted to discuss facet injection and radiofrequency ablation to name several options
7815,get checked swollen tonsil  which can cause ear pain when swallowing  and bad breath is often a sign of strep throat  which must be treated with antibiotics so you don't get complications later please get seen or call your doctor

7818,pea-sized node a pea-sized lymph node wouldn't be considered swollen or enlarged
7819,very low risk duplicate question  same reply syphilis is rarely if ever transmited by hand-genital contact  fingering  etc virtually all syphilis is from vaginal  anal or oral sex and open lesions of the penis aren't likely due to syphilis  and if your partner isn't gay or bi  it's unlikely he had syphilis multiple open lesions of penis is of concern for herpes -- also low risk  but more so than syphilis
7820,not sure i am not sure if you are asking if adderall would help the heart burn it probably would not there are a number of medications which contain a similar component to adderall that are formulated for depression if your current regimen is not helpful  speak about this with your doctor he/she can make modifications
7821,tmj tmj

7967,nocturnal nocturnal ( nighttime) numbness and tingling and pain in the hand can be associated with carpal tunnel syndrome while diabetes can give peripheral neuropathy typically the tingling associated with diabetic neuropathy will affect both hands equally as well as the feet however with diabetes or any other systemic problem that can affect nerves and circulation  the presence of the underlying disorder can worsen the symptoms of carpal tunnel when it gets worse this also means that diabetes sometimes prevents the pain form occurring early on and when it does occur may feel worse suddenly nonetheless the reason carpal tunnel seems to be worse at night when sleeping is several fold 1  the pressure on the nerve is increased by the increased tissue pressure form lying down  the fluid that sits outside the cells redistributes itself to the face and upper extremity when someone lies down ( its why feet are swollen at the end of the day and the face feels puffy and fingers stiff in the am) this extra fluid increases the pressure on the nerve a second thing that often occurs when one sleeps unsplnted is that the wrists flexed or extended  also putting more pressure on the nerve the pressure builds  the fingers go numb  pain follows and finally the pain build enough to awaken the sufferer to start  a simple wrist splint may suffice to help with the night time symptoms not too tight as that can cause pressure on the nerve too defeating the purpose next antiinflammatories  otc non steroidal antiinflammatories but if someone is a diabetic taking other medications then they should always check with their pcp/family doctor/internist or endocrinologist before taking nsaid' s as the y can have a deleterious effect upon renal ( kidney) function a pcp may prescribe antiinflammatories as well injections of corticosteroids are often used acutely by hand surgeons for non operative care a nerve conduction study and emg can help define/delineate the role of carpal tunnel v  neuropathy start with a pcp and consider seeing a hand surgeon once the work up is initiated  
7968,double double vision indicates that your two eyes are not alligned this can be secondary to the muscles that control your eye movements or to the nerves that control the muscles i recommend seeking a neuro-ophhthalmologist for a full workup
7969,discomfort a dental euphemism that it's going to hurt but a skilled oral surgeon will help you manage things post-surgically remember that the pain will be transient  and less of a problem than the damage impacted wisdom teeth can cause i had mine out  and found it to be a very survivable experience pick a qualified oral surgeon and go for it
7970,celexa and lexapro celexa is citalopram and lexapro is ecitalopram  they are related and very similar much of the time there is an individual preference of one or the other and it is important to determine which one is personally preferred generally lexapro is slightly preferred and celexa was recently shown at high doses to have a risk of cardiac arrhythmia
7971,most mammograms are the gold standard for breast cancer screening  but they are not 100% in addition to yearly mammograms  you should be having a clinical breast exam performed by a physician
7972,yes modern treatment planning allows for equal control in selected patients in select series; however  formal comparisons have not been made  and most consider surgery the standard
7973,toothaches toothaches are a difficult problem and there can be many causes for them without having met you i can only guess as to what is going on  but i would consider asking your dentist for a referral to see an endodontist for a consultation endodontists specialize in the nerve of the teeth and from what you're describing it sounds as though your nerve is irritated  dying or is already dead sometimes after having dental work done (such as getting a crown placed) the nerve can be irritated and just needs time to relax and go back to normal sometimes though  the nerve can be permantently damaged to no fault of the dentist (it can just happen sometimes) and will need a root canal if your gums are inflammed  then there's probably truth to what your dentist said about getting the gums cut back as the inflammation will usually not resolve itself and will only lead to more destruction in the mouth unless it's corrected by the minor surgery gum sensitivity typically won't lead to the nerve pain you're describing however  so this tooth might have more than one issue going on with it best of luck
7974,i i applaud your desire to have information before you arrive to the appointment a few questions would be helpful did you ever have symptoms in the past? any involvement of your eyes? was the positive csf oligoclonal bands or elevated igg index? the information you presented best fits with a monsymptomatic presentation as defined by the mcdonald's criteria which was designed to define those individuals who are likely to develop ms to secure the diagnosis you would need another clinical event or a change in your mri after 3 months they will probably want further testing including veps (visual evoked potentials) or oct (optical coherence tomography) the lab evaluation will include an ana  b12  folate  esr  vitamin d panel and routine labs they may also want a mri of the thoracic spine if the exam suggests spinal cord involvement good luck and well wishes
7975,role varies if you have had an operation  there is no role for xrt in stage i or stage ii if medistinal lymph nodes are involved  chemotherapy is in order  and you may benefit from radiotherapy to the chest when you cannot or don't have surgery  some astounding results with hi tech  hi fraction raiotherapy for stage ii  (+ hilar nodes)  i'd be very careful with claims!
7976,possibly inner ear i would see an ent specialist to hopefully get more answers
7977,no the mercury bound the mercury in your fillings is chemically bound and safe good amalgam fillings need not be replaced having your amalgams polished will increase their longevity however if and when your dentist deems they need replacing  they may opt off some newer  bonded  tooth colored materials!
7978,tough tough to answer this question with out actually seeing you like invisalign he best as it is by far the least invasivethen consider porcelain veneers or emax/porcelain crowns which it sounds like you already have lastly  direct bonding which is the least expensive  yet effective way to handle some of your problems
7979,lung & copd no there are strict guidelines concerning surgery and pul func tests  but not so for radiotherapy usually breathing actually improves  but a lot depends on location i would have radiotherapy for lung cancer if i had copd without question
7980,you you are right  clicking can be a sign of tmj some clicking will resolve on its own though you could try a nonprescription mouthguard to wear at night  and try getting a new pillow at night that is orthopedically correct if you have continued clicking  have pain  or pain with mouth opening  then you should be seen
7981,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
7982,you you have symptoms which are classic for gallstone disease and have been diagnosed with gallstones with what i assume was an ultrasound of the abdomen those are the only indications you need for surgery i would not wait until you have further symptoms or your symptoms worsen each time you have a gallbladder attack  you experience some chronic inflammation the more attacks you have  the more difficult it will make your surgery i would not waste any time
7983,thyroid thyroid nodules are somewhat common they are more common in older patients and females the vast majority of thyroid nodules are benign that means they have no significance and can be ignored however  imaging cannot reliably differentiate benign nodules from cancer the decision to biopsy should be made between you and your physician thyroid biopsy is safe and relatively easy for the patient who will usually have a small sore bruise after the procedure in my practice  i have to do about 20 biopsies to find one cancer i hope this helps
7984,prosthodontist see a prosthodontist they are specialists in repairing and replacing missing and broken down teeth they can refer you to the proper specialists as needed to solve your problem

7986,albrightsville  if albrightsville  if the swelling is unresponsive to the antibiotic; either it is a bacterial infection that is unresponsive to that antibiotic  a blockage of the gland  or maybe a viral infection there are always some other things that are scary  but very unlikely a good ent or an oral surgeon is the next step ps if it gets bigger when you eat and smaller upon waking  it is usually a blockage hope this is helpful  michael i wollock  dmd  agd fellow dentistry at suburban square 610-649-0313
7987,dermatological dermatological conditions are always difficult to diagnose without seeing them if they are new and itchy  then conditions such as hives should be considered if they are flat and scaly  a viral rash like pityriasis could be considered  these are usually reddish however if they have a clear vesicle (bubble) on top  then chicken pox should be considered consulting a physician for a rash on a child is always a good idea  so the best advice would be to have her doctor take a look at that
7988,part of the process the process of dental bonding is a general procedure by which fillings  crowns  veneers  orthodontic brackets can be connected to teeth it is a biochemical process by which these materials literally become chemically bonded to the tooth structure the process is technique sensitive and varies slightly for each type of procedure  but it is very often used with fillings & very successful!
7989,i agree your jaw surgery may change your mid face  and thus your nose do the jaw first
7990,gallstones gallstones and their symptoms can be highly variable from one person to another many people can walk around and feel normal with gallstones  and they do not need surgery other people with gallstones get upper abdominal gas and pressure discomforts with nausea or vomiting if you hare having gallstone pain and symptoms  which usually get worse with eating fatty or greasy foods  then you should see you family doctor to see if they recommend referral to a surgeon probably also not the best to wait for severe unrelenting abdominal pain and vomiting to occur
7991,absolutely sometimes they are in the wrong place for final orthodontic goals  sometimes they are wonderful as anchors to help move other teeth effectively; but in the end there is always a work-around and yes  orthodontics can be done with implants best of luck!

7995,hopefully hopefully you follow the other doctors responses and got to your dentist  if not  you are just asking for a major problem to happen please do not wait any longer
7996,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well

8001,i i recommend that you see a provider and receive appropriate therapy
8002,if if otherwise in good health even at 75  some consideration of the risks and benefits of treatment versus no treatment should be held with a cerebrovascular expert one consideration may be coiling of the aneurysm  which does not involve surgery depending on the location of the aneurysm and the expertice of the surgeon  very successful results can be expected at a major medical center even with surgery always take advantage of getting another opinion  even if it is just to get more information
8003,not enough info unfortunately  there is not enough information to answer your question what kind of composite filling was used  what placement technique (direct vs indirect)  what kind of bonding method was used  was a liner placed before the fillings were placed i have not encountered a problem like yours in over twenty years i'd seek out a second opinion!
8004,it it sounds like you have an amalgam tattoo which can occur during filling removal it is 100 benign and you should not worry about it if you are concerned have your dentist check and make sure that is what it is
8005,recommend recommend an evaluation by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon to determine the source of your jaw pain and to evaluate the third molars the two things are probably not related but both pose a potential problem for you long term the jaw pain could be due to a joint problem  muscle problem  or an infection
8006,no no but the use of mri for evaluation of the breast is increasing  mri does not require any squeezing today mammogram is still the gold standard   along with monthly self exams and yearly breast exams by your primary care provider
8007,agree agree with the above post one other possibility is that when the filling fell out  the nerve in the tooth became exposed and underwent a proliferation (growing) reaction called a pulp polyp depending upon the amount of tooth structure remaining for the dentist to be able to reconstruct the tooth you may either need a root canal or extraction see your dentist immediately
8008,probably not but many troubled teens self medicate with drugs
8009,yes the studies on teens are fewer than in adults  but most of us in clinical practice have found that most antidepressants work well in teenagers we do need to be extra careful and vigilant in treating teens with depression  because the medications may increase some suicidal thinking and behaviors in some teens in my experience  antidepressant medications plus psychotherapy works well in teens

8028,stye / chalazia the swollen pouch of the lower lid is probably an accumulation of fluid that settles in that area due to gravity it can take some time to resolve heat definitely helps styes to resolve  but may temporarily increase swelling sometimes if it is tender  you might have to use a cool compress or ice on the area to help reduce inflammation ophthalmic ointment antibiotics may work better than drops

8227,most likely anxiety it was most likely anxiety but you might want to get a check up for possible heart poblems

8229,painful ankle any kind of blunt trauma to the ankle can cause pain and swelling  the swelling can affect the superficial nerve endings that feed the part of your foot that is cold please consult and podiatrist of foot and ankle specialist as soon as you can so that they can check if the circulation to that toe has not been affected as well
8230,yes in short  the lesions can vary a little that said  they rarely completely disappear what is more common is for the appearance of some lesions on certain mri sequences to change in the spine  however  it can sometimes be difficult to see lesions that are not active  while in the brain it will typically stay abnormal
8231,neuropathy check to see if your client has had back pain  leg pain and sciatic pain sometimes neuropathy can accompany these conditions and can originate in the toes and feet
8232,mri for ms yes 15tesla mri is considered high field strength and is the standard at many institutions there are 3t mri available but this is not necessary to see ms lesions the company is siemens and they are one of the major mri producers
8233,red legs many things can cause redness in the legs; infections  vascular conditions  blood clots to name a few i would recommend evaluation by your primary care physician
8234,see an oral surgeon i would suggest seeing an oral surgeon to assess your symptoms if you were told that you have cystic degeneration around an impacted wisdom tooth then this should be treated by an os do not put this off even if it resolves because it will return and likely be worse the next time

8239,thyroid nodules thyroid nodules are divided in hot or cold by thyroid nuclar scan cold nodules are the one's than in some % may be cancerous and require biopsy any tissue that grows too fast is suspicious for malignancy we also dive thyroid ovules in functional ( with changes in the thyroid hormones) and not functional ( with normal thyroid dunction tests)
8240,obvious untruth think if what you are saying is true  more women who have mammograms would die of breast cancer than women who have not had mammograms no one's dumb enough to claim this the actual increase in breast cancer is due mostly to women living longer and foregoing motherhood / lactation you're an adult and are smart enough to have found healthtap; don't be a sucker for obviously-false web claims
8241,polyclonal gammopath polyclonal gammopathy is not the same as monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (mgus) or associated disorders such as myeloma  lymphoma  or leukemia poly=many clones is normal having an increase in immunoglobulins (ig's  antibodies) can be associated with autoimmune disorders  hiv  hepatitis  etc there may be some other reason to see a hematologist  but not b/c of polyclonal ig's
8242,yes yes  this is normal is the pain and bleeding is occurring in the areas where the wisdom teeth are cutting through the gums is this pain and bleeding is happening in other areas of your mouth  you have gingivitis or periodontitis please see the dentist for an exam
8243,i would try taking the prescription metanx it is a vitamin that works very well with small nerve fiber neuropathy
8244,yes a disc hernia requires no treatment  unless it is causing symptoms symptoms result when a herniated disc is pinching or compressing an adjacent nerve physical therapy  avoidance of activities that provoke the pain  and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine are often helpful more than 50% of patients will eventually have complete relief of symptoms without requiring surgery or steroids

8246,reasonable this is a reasonable option if you respond well with a scs trial good luck

8248,neurologist i see you got an echocardiogram  if negative result  and you don't have any other cardiac risk factors  and not using heart medications like isordil  i will continue with neurologist
8249,does not matter it is persistent asthma that is uncontrolled and symptomatic nightly awakenings are likely also more importantly  the dose of anti-inflammatory medication must be increased  for example inhaled steroids to be safe check with your lung doc to make nothing else is going on - although unlikely
8250,no you should see doctor and get placed on medications that are approved by the fda to treat depression using alcohol and recreational drugs is a poor way to handle depression and can make things worse
8251,possible but you first need to implement life style modification and de-stress it is spring time  take a walk in nature drink a cup of chamomile at bedtime remove electronics from your bedroom get a nutrition consult do a cleanse try yoga or meditation and if you need more help look up fisher wallace cranial stimulator
8252,yes tmj will cause popping sounds and a deviation of the jaw upon opening and closing check with your dentist you will most likely need a bite guard no to the second part of your question tmj does not cause hearing loss i have had patients with some hearing loss from tmj  but it is corrected with a bite guard
8253,need more info i'm sure that it feels that you have a double dose of risk  but  if these are your only family members with breast (or ovarian) ca  you are not high-risk for hereditary breast ca (we tend to see this type in families with multiple members with ca  especially prior to menopause or when in both breasts) & can wait till 40 that said  a mammogram is a small price to pay for peace of mind
8254,sinus pressure sinus pressure can cause the upper teeth to hurt so bad you think you need root canals the lower teeth are not usually affected unless you are also clenching and grinding your teeth due to the sinus pain and pressure
8255,appropriate it sounds like your son was appropriately placed on a controller medication (brown) and a reliever medication (ventolin) if his problems with sleep is new he may have an exacerbation of his asthma and you should seek medical attention immediately if this has been occurring for a while his controller medication may need to be adjusted and he should see his doctor
8256,tenderness in my practice tenderness is a sign of muscular inflammation or irritation or sensitivity this psin is mot surgicall y treatable somrthing as simple as actrigger point injection can illuminate a mew treatment pathway and cofirm the pain generator structural pain generators are not palpable
8257,no even in the extraordinarily low likelihood that the scope was not sterilized between patient the cancer cells in and of themselves would not be harmful as cancer is not contagious!
8258,wisdom tooth cyst yes  it should pass but in many cases healing is a bit slower  especially if the cyst was an enlarging type
8259,depression ? it is very important to treat and medications for depression r not addictive sometimes u need medications and speech therapy which can be the best approach   if u r concerned about medication u can try therapy first and if it does not work u can add medication in addition   exercise and acupuncture may work also
8260,allergies these certainly sounds like allergic symptoms  though allergy can be a trigger for asthma as well as nasal and eye symptoms allergy testing and a pulmonary test such as spirometry may be indicated
8261,worrisome any pain down the back of your calf that is tender to touch and hurts when you walk should be checked out any horrible pain anywhere should be evaluated two goods reasons to seek attention your symptoms are worrisome this could certainly be a dvt
8262,more evaluation there are many types of neck masses it may be as simple as a bony extension off the side of the cervical spine to tumor since you seem to still have questions may need second opinion  needle biopsy  or imaging to arrive at diagnosis
8263,yes an echocardiogram which is negative does not 'rule out' endocarditis it just means that whatever is there isn't seen on echo you have too many other positive signs get blood cultures
8264,no it is very difficult to advise patients over the internet without actually being able to clinically examine them and in this case see the x-rays of the area both before and after the removal of the wisdom teeth therefore  i can only give you some general comments while it is not normal  it can happen if i were the patient  i would get an opinion from another trusted oral surgeon asap more>
8265,crutch/cast/xray sounds like you injured the joints or bone(s) in your midfoot thats why it feels ok if you walk on your heel alone some of the injuries require stress xrays or mri to determine if there is a potential instability that requires casting at least with serial xrays and possibily even surgery metatarsal cuneiform joint injuries (lis franc) are notorious for displacing slowly if not traated
8266,it's possible do a home pregnancy test take care!
8267,not necessary although an ankle sprain may be swollen and painful  usually rest  icing and bracing may be suffice try a compression wrap or a simple ankle brace for 1-2 weeks if pain and swelling gets worse  then see a doctor for referral  possible imaging studies to see if the injury is more serious than just a sprain i hope this helps  if so  please vote or follow me thanks!
8268,what r u doing? what r u doing when this happens? is there any pain in your neck? are you leaning on the armrest? is your head cricked over into one position for a long time? see your doctor with your observations and maybe he/she can hlep you
8269,dry eye? also  with lupus  you are at risk for severe dry eyes that can potentially lead to all your symptoms you can do an easy test try otc preservative-free artificial tears  1 drop every hour and see if your symptoms improve at all either way  because your risk for dry eyes is so great  you should probably see an eye md as well
8270,spots sounds like traumatic areas  many possible causes  how long they been there

8273,see an ent doctor this could be reflux esophagitis  but with neg endoscopy less likely esophageal diverticulum  or possibly vocal cord lesion or post nasal drip from sinus congestion are all possible could be thyroid but less likely without obvious neck expansion see an ent doctor they may help with this
8274,yes heat   motrin  and flexeril are a great combination
8275,mcrocytic anemiaa you should get b12 and folate levels checked first  later you may need further work up eg pernicious anemia/
8276,normal your thyroid values are normal many of the tests that were run on you don't help in diagnosis and are just a waste of blood and money
8277,probably not you did not say f you ever fainted or have had dizzy spells or if there is a family history of heart disease  fainting/dizzy spells  or sudden death absent any of those  there is likely no reason to have more tests
8278,well benign lymph nodes are not palpable also on breast mri they can tell if it was a lymph node by its shape and enhancement pattern the problem is that lymph nodes have a washout pattern similar to that seen with cancer i do not think the mammogram will help but you can do it on a 3d hologics digital unit this needs followup
8279,call your surgeon i dont treat knee's but i do perform surgery on feet and ankles if your having a post operative complication which you may be experiencing you need to contact your surgeon asap this may or may not be normal after that type of surgery
8280,soon once the pain and bleeding starts to improve you can start with a soft diet and advance as your mouth allows you'll be eating a normal diet before you know it!
8281,an ethical dilemma only a careful examination can allow this question to be answered by me when i have this situation with a patient  i ask: if we do crown lengthening and a crown and later you lost the tooth  would you be upset or are you the patient that says i want to do whatever i can to keep my tooth as long as i can? think about which you are and it may help you decide good luck
8282,tmj most likely clicking joints are indicative of a disk movement or displacement if your jaw clicks on opening and you can feel a slight clunk on closing this is termed a disk displacement with reduction and indicates that your jaw is out of position when you teeth are together and you disk goes back into position when you open you will most likely need tmj therapy from a trained dentist to resolve it
8283,no might have a fracture and or soft tissue damage and activity will make it worse try rice method rest  ice  compression and elevation and get checked before activity
8284,hmm there are many possibilities  one of them could be ligamental tear
8285,probably uri these are classic and common symptoms for many viral illnesses  along with muscle soreness (myalgias)  headaches and fever however  more info is needed to be sure a more serious infection or other process imitating uri is present and if someone has asthma or copd (emphysema)  a tight chest can indicate less airflow
8286,anas not marker for anas not markers for cancer of course  any undefined pain could be ca  but at your age very unlikely your systemic lupus panel does exonerate you from likely connective tissue disease  and your other tests are ok  except for the esr i would have my pcp get a crp esrs in my opinion should rarely be done if crp elevated  probably inflammation somewhere  the more likely cause for pain!
8287,let's talk i'm a lot more worried about your going faint and bumping into something i'm most concerned about a transient ischemic episode  and you need to get with your personal physician
8288,headache i am sure ouch if you were not knocked unconcious odds are you do not have a concussion headache ? i can imagine if it has been >72 hours and you are not developing more concerning neurological symptoms  then you are probably out of the woods
8289,possible your dysthesia seems to be in the branch of the mandibular nerve  a branch of the trigeminal nerve could be a form of trigeminal neuralgia  related to your poly neuropathy unless you had a procedure done  such as a wisdom tooth extraction  that damaged the nerve directly
8290,sciatica treatment true sciatica is leg pain that shoots from back  down the leg past the knee this mimics the path of the sciatic nerve  thus it's name it may be associated with numbness  burning pain  or weakness in the leg treatment involves nsaids  tylenol  rest  mckenzie pt with a doc's rx  and steroid injections (nerve root or epidural) failing that  microdiskectomy if disk herniation confirmed by mri
8291,hcg if you are not pregnant and you have a detectable level of hcg  then you should be checked for the presence of a tumor that secrets hcg  because having hcg elevations apart from pregnancy is not normal

8293,simple treatments! if you only have dandruff sx   really priasis  you can get a good effect with neutratar shampoos and their knock-offs  on a zinc pyrythione 1% shampoo i have patients alternate every two days with great results ketoconazole shampoo works very well  but requires a prescription i wager that these will work well!
8294,yes get baseline sca about ten years prior to your mom's cancer is typical to obtaining your baseline mammogram get a very good family history from both mom and dad then look into having your mom tested for hereditary breast cancer if she's neg for the abnormal gene then you don't have to worry nearly as much just keep getting screened yearly starting ten yrs prior to mom's cancer supreme court lowered testing $$!
8295,swelling and pain given his age and this abnormal situation i think the child needs to be seen by his pediatrician
8296,possible sprain not sure about mechanism of injury (twist  fall  hit by a car  etc) so just from the swelling and bruise it could be possibly a sprain also  could be injury to the joint  tendon  or bone but unable to be sure without imaging or fully history and exam hope you see your doctor for referral to a specialist best of luck
8297,for future: and any related questions: persistent ice application (with skin protection) for the first 48 hours then moist heat for the second 48hour period take nsaids like ibuprofen 800mg every 6-8 hours as prescribed and sleep slightly elevated for the first 72 hours from a surgeon's perspective  pre-op or intra-opertive steroid administration is very helpful
8298,bruxism someone may grind their teeth for a number of reasons often  the problem occurs because the muscles of the face and jaw are trying to get the teeth in a comfortable position the muscles may be in spasm  you may have a tmj/tmd problem  stress  infection best to see a dentist asap often thew cause is difficult to determine  so may have to treat the symptoms with a mouthpiece

8306,possible bruxism bruxism can cause teeth to chip away by allowing too much constant pressure continually on these teeth have your dentist check for this type of wear
8307,not ms causation yes  ms patients do have susceptibility for infections  but relapses do not cause temperature elevation  and your high fever does need medical attention furthermore  elevated temps can promote ms pseudo relapses  and viral infections can trigger true relapses
8308,mammo recall it is rare that a patient is recalled for a technical error on a mammo but occasionally it happens much more likely in your case is that the radiologist identified a potential abnormality on the screening study  which required special extra views to better evaluatethe spot compression on the extra views is much more effective at spreading out the tissue than the general compression of screenin
8309,concussion post concussive headaches are tough naproxen can be helpful excercize by doing yoga! de stress  no caffeine  drink water sleep regularly if they persist past three months from trauma one should see headache specialist to start a preventative medication
8310,it is you should also let your obstetrician know about your problem long term antibiotics is not a good thing and you need to weigh the risks vs the benefits of having the wisdom tooth removed if you need to have it removed the safest time is during the second trimester
8311,evaluation dry socket is just one of the possible reasons for the discomfort you could have discomfort from being open wide or the actual procedure which are all within normal limits if you are still unsure or worried  then you should go back to the surgeon to have them evaluate to make sure you are healing
8312,may be both? as another doctor has suggested  you may need a more detailed lung function with dlco to confirm the suggestive ct finding on the other hand  if your lung function has become nearly normal after asthma treatment and your sob has mostly gone  the likelihood of ild would be quite low
8313,it depends   this depends on the nature of your thyroid nodule  and your thyroid values if your thyroid hormone is high  the nodule may be the cause and a test involving radioactive iodine should be done if positive  it would mean it is a source of extra hormone and is hot if not and it is cold  then another biopsy and tests should be done to rule out cancer so see your dr and get more tests

8316,need to follow go to your family doctor   if you don't find one in your neighborhood through your family or friends  need follow up and preventive care of your bp
8317,thorough rinsing by this time there should be a sufficient base of clot in the socket so thorough rinsing after meals and snacks is usually sufficient to keep the socket clean enough for the next week try to eat as much as possible on the other side and avoid hard crumbly foods that might more easily get stuck or irritate the socket you should be fine
8318,get chacked notcopd it is unlikely that you have copd but you should get checked as you do have phlegm and shortness of breath and may have acute bronchits and need evaluation and appropriate treatment and you need counseling and advice to stop smoking  because if you keep smoking you will end up with copd for sure
8319,tooth or gums? that is the question if the soreness is at the gum line it could be toothbrush abrasion or abfraction ( from premature contact) or recession if the soreness is coming from below the crown of the tooth  it could be infected infections come from decay or trauma although there can be a combination of endoperio if you want a difinitive answer  i recommend a dental appointment to be sure

8326,yes it depends on the pain deep or any filling could have sensitivity to cold or hot but should go away within seconds after swallow if it lingers for a minute this is not a good sign the filling should not move or fall out that is not normal
8327,not unusual it is not unusual to have some blood in the chest tube frequently  particularly in the case of trauma  there is a hemo-pneumothorax that is  there is blood also in the space between the lung and the pleural space this is effectively drained by the chest tube
8328,common symptom many people have pac and pvc during the course of the day some are very aware and feel every one and others have no idea they are happening with such a complete cardiac workup you should feel reassured there is no cause for concern caffeine  stress and some otc weight loss meds can exacerbate the symptoms regular exercise and dietary change and getting good sleep may help
8329,many psychiatrists recommend a cross titration in which celexa is being reduced as the paxil is being increased this is done to prevent ssri discontinuation symptoms - but is not always seamless as time goes on ; medications are titrated this should resolve take care
8330,need eval there are many types of ha's- most common being migraines which can present in different forms however with your neck and ear pain - you need eval by a doctor and likely a scan of your head if you haven't had one it would be to eval for tumors aneurysms and other abnormalities- these are less likely
8331,multiple symptoms no doubt you could be pregnant even though you're breastfeeding it doesn't confer 100% protection however  if pregnancy test is negative and say a repeat one in 2 weeks is negative again  there should be another reason explaining these symptoms
8332,lhermittes is not ms lhermitte's phenomenon can occur for many reasons your normal mri studies and exam should eliminate ms and intervertebral disc disease as the causes it is not clear what the cause is  but you should feel reassurred  based on these findings
8333,lot of tests that's an awful lot of tests you've probably seen enough cardiologists if you have also seen a lung specialist there isn't much left to look for have you never been treated for anxiety to see if you feel better?
8334,relax 95% of nodules seen on ct scan are benign nodules <7mm are usually just observed the usual course of action is to get another scan 3-6 months later to check for a change in size if it is bigger  then biopsy or resection would be appropriate
8335,why if claritin is not sufficient to control symptoms  it can be changed to another long acting antihistamine otc benadryl is great for short term use with severe symptoms (hives) but it has side effects that bother most after playing outside  have him shower and flush his nose with saline to get the pollen off keep windows closed see his doc to ask about other medicines that might help if needed
8336,see a physiatrist a rehabilitation medicine doctor (pmr) can diagnose if the problem is a muscle strain  pinched nerve in the neck  shoulder impingement syndrome  scapular dyskinesia  or other  then prescribe physical therapy  pain medicine   complementary/alternative medicine or injections if needed
8337,very unlikely women often times get sebaceous cysts under the skin of the breast they are usually more common on the underside of the breast where your bra rubs the skin sometimes you do need an antibiotic ointment for these however  there are other types of lumps you can have at your age like accessory nipples and breast cysts  so if it persists see your physician for an exam
8338,it is likely the prolonged bleeding which has contributed to vulvovaginitis it sounds like you need to see your doc antibiotics or a medicine for yeast would likely help the swelling you may need the birth control pill or some hormone to help the bleeding do this before you develop anemia good luck
8339,eat!!!! i'm sure the surgeon did not tell you that you could not eat after 6 days there should be enough closure over the socket sites to eat filet mignon go treat yourself!
8340,see the doctor don't wait around with this one see the gi md right away can be many things  some of which can be serious go good luck
8341,unlikely they may want to easily remove it all the best enjoy your baby
8342,sometimes needed i would be careful about the use of the word dependence  usually this term refers to substances that induce a condition that makes a person want to continue using the substance in the case of antidepressants  a person is already depressed and medication is used for treatment some people need chronic treatment  but the medicine did not cause a dependency
8343,possible but rare after day 4 or 5 a dry socket becomes less likely if you are experiencing constant severe pain in the area of extraction and even a burning sensation there then you most likely have one if so get back to the surgeon to have the socket packed if the pain is intolerable it will eventually heal on its own though
8344,sores on tongue it seems like a viable noninvasive option you can also treat the symptoms by using a mouth rinse of milk of magnesia if after the long weekend you still have the symptoms and they haven't gotten better  see an oral surgeon for a consult/diagnosis
8345,your need to see a you need to see a foot and ankle specialists if your have recurrent ankle sprains and fractures you need to be evaluated for either or both foot ankle bracing or surgery to stabilize the ankle

8347,possibly only if you are at high risk  otherwise wait until after delivering your baby
8348,more info needed how long has the mass been there  and for how long have you been loosing weight and have had no appetite? unfortunately  these types of problems need to be physically examined  together with a full med hx  possible blood work and ct scans trying to guess a diagnosis over the internet is not prudent call your physician for an appointment
8349,sinus symptoms if your upper jaws are what hurts  it may be a sinus infection you can get a headache with this too  as well as a runny nose and a stuffy nose feel better if it seems to worsen  see your doctor for an antibiotic
8350,and pain if you have those symptoms  you're likely have gb dysfunction hida scan can assist to answer the problem
8351,sprains take time to sprains take time to heal but if you are still having pain you should see your foot doctor and have x/rays taken of your ankle and foot to rule out possible ocd injury to you ankle joint
8352,most likely! if you are taking a medicine for anxiety  such as xanax  and your symptoms are relieved when taking the medication  it is likely that your symptoms are those of anxiety xanax and similar medications are specific for anxiety  and do not tend to mask or relieve other symptoms it makes sense to get your heart thoroughly checked to be sure
8353,yes yes
8354,hard to say this would depend on the size of the lump and if it has changed significantly over time if it is mobile and large  this could be suspicious for a cancer you also need to check if there are other lumps that would suggest lymph nodes which could just be infection  but could also represent lymphoma you should have this checked out
8355,see your ddd if you have pain and swelling the root canal treatment should be started immediately the antibiotic alone may not be able to out pace the infections if your dentist is unwilling to start the treatment seek a second opinion antibiotics are not meant to relieve pain
8356,need office visit check with family doctor and or gastroenterologist for detail examination
8357,pregnant? i would see your gynecologist
8358,any specific diagnosis like pots  familiar dysautonomia  shy-drager  severe diabetes  etc most probably your symptoms are due to the dysautonomia other possibilities are gerd  asthma  anxiety attack  hyperthyroid a good history and physical very important talk to your doctor a lot of times a doctor it's like a good detective need time to find the cause
8359,trauma unfortunately   there are lots of structures that can be injured with trauma to the foot   not just bones see your podiatrist for x rays and an evaluation

8364,no no no it is viral  supportive treatment only  fluids tylenol albuterol may be helpful
8365,no you can't take all at the same time if you need more antihistamines to treat a condition consult a physician

8602,35 ml tylenol or acetaminophen now comes only in one strength for its liquid preperations i e 160mg/5ml to avoid potential over dosage due to more concentrated tylenol infants drops until recent past the dose charts are generally included on packages for older children but a rough guidefor safe dosing is ~10 mg/kg per dose given on bottles
8603,if symptoms  yes if you are experiencing a penile discharge  you may need to be retested and retreated but use of a condom can reduce the chance of exposure
8604,urinalysis it is difficult to place meaning on this without knowing how the urine was collected if it was not with a clean midstream catch it may be that the blood came from the vagina rather than the bladder the fact that the culture was negative has nothing to do with the presence or absence of blood since it does not measure this 
8605,hit head well if you didn't lose consciousness  you have no change in your vision  you have no nausea or vomiting  no numbness or tingling  you are speaking well to others then it is very unlikely that you have a significant injury if these things change or when you push on your skull where you hit your skull moves then you need to be seen

8611,duration and change skin issues common  male breast unusual it used to be exclusively older men  but camp lejeune cluster in marines  family and vets suggest environmental toxin if the lump has been there and has not changed  i'd worry less if it is enlarging  red  and painful  see a surgeon cancer usually is not painful  but it needs removal and sent to path to analyze
8612,side effects these are not common side effects of penicillin but if you experience them every time you're on penicillin  it apparently affects you that way some patients are more intolerant of any medication than other patients
8613,unrelated hi anemia is more related to increased heart rate bp is more related to volume status and vascular tone generally  i'd say anemia causes neither high nor low bp  but a faster pulse
8614,new infection you had viral infection it doesnt need antibiotic it runs it's course it can end up in bacterial infection then you need antibiotic your doctor saw evidence of bacterial infection in throat/sinus and gave you amoxi now you have bacterial infection in lungs amoxi doesnt work here if no fever and general sickness you can wait o/w you will need a different kind of antibiotic

8622,yes a cta will be able to detect abnormal lung masses with fairly decent accuracy the test of choice would be a ct without contrast  however most radiologists can read through the added contrast material

8626,when to repeat mri if the mri is normal  it would probably not be worth repeating for awhile there is some value to using contrast and that is typical for ms protocol mri the 15 tesla strength is fine though people under consideration for ms as a diagnosis may have a repeat mri after 6 months or so hope that helps!
8627,symptoms undiagnosed it is good news that the mri looked normal that pretty much rules out ms it can be helpful to visit with a neurologist though  since the symptoms returned they handle symptoms like those that occur in ms and other kinds of conditions
8628,prodrome certainly serious symptoms you may be in the earliest stages of shingles; however  see your physician for a complete exam and ct of head and neck for starters 
8629,missed period one in four normal patients conceive per cycle since you already have missed your expected menses  i would wait one week after expected period and test

8633,irritated gum your dentist may be referring to inflammation caused by plaque  a film on the teeth that can inflame the gums the good news is that your dentist told you that you had no serious dental problems otherwise  serious gum disease and dental decay - periodontal disease - can cause irritation of the tooth's nerve roots  possibly requiring a root canal procedure hope that helps

8639,24 - 48 hours it can take up to 48 hours for antibiotics to make a difference with a dental infection i hope you have made an appointment to have the tooth treated unlike other bacterial infections in the body  a dental infection will not go away simply with antibiotics the source of the infection  needs to be removed (root canal therapy)  assuming the tooth can be saved good luck

8659,arteriogram an arteriogram is the test used to diagnose clogged arteries a vascular surgeon should be involved in the workup if this diagnosis is suspected clinically even before any imaging tests are ordered in less urgent situations  an exercise test on a treadmill can screen patients for blockages in the leg arteries before arteriograms are performed

8665,deconditioning if the cardiac and pulmonary work up is negative (if not evaluated should do so) then the likely cause is deconditioning from lack of exercise and obesity check with your physician if you may begin a walking program and slowly increase your level of activity you will notice as your functional level increases your shortness of breath increases
8666,it's possible it is possible to have some bright red blood in your stool with a hemorrhoid or an anal fissure (a tear in the tissue) however  it's always best to visit your doctor when you have rectal bleeding as there can be other  more serious causes
8667,sti testing time two weeks after potential exposure should be a good time to be tested and i would add hiv to the list practicing safe sex is essential in protecting yourself from these stis receptive anal sex is perhaps the highest rate of transmission please use your condoms

8720,if you can feel it if you or your physician can feel something abnormal then an ultrasound should be performed furthermore  your doctors need to be absolutely certain that the mammogram includes the area of abnormality seen on the ct scan it is also possible that this lump has been present over many mammogram exams and is now considered benign ask for your mammo&ct reports and discuss with your doc&radiologist
8721,no there are occassional strikes of lightening twice in the same patient  but it is not due to a scientific link breast cancer has no ling to smoking or tobacco  and the link is very strong with lung cancer we could stop 90% of lung cancer by cigarettes disappearing  but we don't have that fortune with breast cancer notice that cigarettes are still leader and many geniuses exercise their freedom
8722,depends if the tumor is hormone positive and or her2 positive there is chemo hormone blockerstypically  radiation  lumpectomy followed by anti hormone meds on the other hand  triple negative breast cancer stage i will most likely need chemotherapy iv it is a bit controversial about a tumor less than 5mm  but anything above that has lumpectomy  node bx  and adjuvant chemonow  docs are trying chemo presurg
8723,you need to talk to your doctor about what the findings suggest the addition of the mri to the mix could mean almost anything it could mean that they really don't think there is anything going on  but just want to have a higher level of certainty about it  or it could mean there is something very abnormal  and they are trying to determine extent of disease again  call your doctor to find out
8724,not necessarily seeing ovarian cancer or not from ct without contrast is less desirable and accurate but if an ovarian cancer is big and calcified  it can be easily suspected as how it may look but  following the specific ct protocol for a specific suspected tumor so to have better visualization and diagnosis is highly recommended detail? ask radiologist
8725,yes she can get pregnant if the first day of her last menstrual period was 12-18 days ago

8727,uncertain check with your dentist or oral surgeon it depends on the exact procedure done and anticipated healing
8728,10 minutes typically oral surgeons can do this quickly and easily as they do it every day often instead of grafting they can place an implant in the socket which the process and reduces cost i schedule these surgeries for 10 minutes plus time for local anesthesia if the patient will be awake this includes the implant i do lots of them  close to 1000 per year so i may be a little faster than some
8729,possible fracture the area i think you are describing is the base of the fifth metatarsal this is a common bone to break you need to be checked out

8764,expect 3 months peak inflammatory changes at the carpal tunnel occur around 6 weeks post op  but can be present for up to 3 months right now you are at the peak there are several modalities you can use post op to improve that swelling/pain: massage  ultrasound  medications (both oral and topical)  therapy  and soaking to name a few this happens on 100% of my carpal pt's and i do about 300 a year

8771,cancer concern you already know that smoking is bad for you good stop smoking  then you can stop worrying about cancer your spine pain may be cancer  tho unlikely--that should have shown up on your imaging most likely you have musculoskeletal issues such as chronic sprain or repetitive stress injury internal problems of lungs  intestinal tract  kidneys etc must also be considered get another opinion

8775,severity in general  bone grafting pain from filling a defect in bone is less than the pain from removal of a bony impacted wisdom tooth  but more than removal of a fully erupted wisdom tooth we do a lot of bone grafting and people tend to do quite well your doctor can control your discomfort with medication  but unfortunately none of us can take the pain completely out of a surgical procedure

8794,perhaps although tooth decay cannot occur without exposure to oral bacteria  emergence of the wisdom tooth is a slow process  and yours may have broken the surface some time before you became aware of that fact therefore  although it is uncommon for wisdom teeth to develop decay prior to their eruption  they can have cavities anytime after their embryonic follicle becomes opened to the oral environment
8795,yes unless you are very young (in your twenties) with very short-term symptoms  this is normal for most patients  they have some relief of numbness right after surgery and a lot of relief of night-time pain numbness in the very tips of the fingers is the last thing to get better depending on how long it's gone on and how severe the symptoms have been  this may take a few months
8796,have it evaluated twisting ones’ ankle can lead to soft tissue or bony injuries often times  this may result in ligament or tendon injuries which may lead to ankle bruising  swelling  pain  and possibly instability an x-ray of the foot and ankle will be able to assist in differentiating a sprain form a fracture you may need and mri to diagnose various cartilaginous or soft tissue injuries have it evaluated!

8799,ask your doc in general  i do not see a problem with that type of program but it is really best for someone with knee replacements to discuss the appropriate exercise program with the orthopedist who did the surgery not every surgery is the same and there may be some precautions that are applicable to the individual
8800,dependent on goals if you wish to regain function of the nerve i agree with dr m that seeing a surgeon capable of doing nerve repairs is the best idea repositioning of your foot and ankle may be accomplished by an orthopedic surgeon through fusions or tendon tethering procedures if you are dealing with ulceration caused by the lack of sensation in your foot then you may want to see a dpm or wound care specialist
8801,can be other things such as arthritis at th base of the thumb  or irritation from prolonged dependency on splints may be suspect as well

8806,methadone for pain methadone can be useful for persistent pain but it may be more dangerous than vicodin 40 mgm hydrocodone is not a very large dose methadone can decrease tolerance (the body's need for more pain meds to achieve the same result) and so it must be used carefully when switching from another opioid it can interfere with the electrical conduction in your heart and produce a fatal arrhythmia
8807,ice chips i would try a dental hotline in area if you have one if not  rub some ice chips over the area and tylenol or some anti-inflammatory if can take it and if you cannot get into a dentist soon

8809,probably not directl mitral valve prolapse is a description of how the mitral valve closes it can be associated with a leaking mitral valve if the leak is large enough it can cause parts of the heart to expand and dilate this can predispose you to develop all sorts of rhythm issues but most who have prolapse don't develop svt's because most do not have any significant leak

8822,swelling swelling in the legs can be caused by several different things if one leg becomes swollen suddenly  a blood clot must be considered it sounds like your swelling is in both legs so that is less likely some medications can cause swelling in the legs  so ask your doctor to review your medications for side effects if your circulatory system is having a problem  it can result in leg swelling  so it is important that your heart be evaluted some patients who don't get enough protein in their diet can get leg swelling  a blood test can diagnose this if patients have kidney or liver disease they can get leg swelling; this is determined by blood testing also it sounds like you are having significant pain and persistent swelling so please have this swelling re-evaluated medically
8823,if if you are healthy (other than your gallbladder problem)  without symptoms of urinary retention or obstruction  then it is likely that you will not need a urinary catheter many laparoscopic cholecystectomies are done as an outpatient  ie a few hours up to 23 hours in the ambulatory surgery area  and the procedure is generally between 1-2 hours under these circumstances  a urinary catheter is not usually needed however  you will have to urinate on your own before being discharged home on occasions  a straight cath may be needed  ie a catheter inserted to drain the bladder  if you cannot urinate
8824,from from your description  it could well have been broken when you hurt it a year ago i think the first thing you should do is see a hand surgeon you will probably need an x-ray and a good evaluation by the surgeon
8825,urinary retention severe urinary retention can lead to pain associated to a uti  dilated renal system (hydroureter  hydronephrosis)  or else a kidney infection (pyelonephritis) especially if a history of an enlarged prostate exists and even if he is prescribed flomax a visit to the doctor is definitely needed since the elderly may not show typical symptoms of an adult with a complex urinary tract infection
8826,your your symptoms do not suggest a sinus infection acute sinus infection mostly commonly follows a cold after 10-14 days of a cold  and cold symptoms are not going away  you have to consider a sinus infection the symptoms are nasal congestion  nasal discharge  thick postnasal drainage that is yellowish or greenish particularly soon after arising half of the patients will have sinus headache or pressure mostly commonly at behind the eye area chronic sinus problem (called chronic rhinosinusitis medically) has the same symptoms as above but lasting longer than 3 months many patients have the similar symptoms lasting for months or years fatigue occurs in 80% of patients other symptoms include plugged ears and cough
8827,we we sometimes see hand numbness and swelling with compression of the nerves as they come down through the shoulder under the pectoralis muscle if the mri's are normal ms is not a considerationif the ncv shows no nerve slowing at the wrist ask your doctor to feel for tight knots in the pectoralis minor muscle or just above the collar bone this is treated with stretching exercises and is often seen with poor posture it is most common in women with large breasts and in people who spend the day hunched over a computer keyboard
8828,visibly visibly bulging veins in the legs are often the result of http://www nuvelaestheticacom/veins_new/vein-diseasehtml>venous reflux  a condition where the blood in the deep veins of the leg is misdirected to the surface veins in a reverse flow pattern   rather than to the heart  as intended these veins are best treated by identifying the sources of venous reflux that feed them  and shutting them down traditionally   this was done surgically with the all too familiar vein stripping procedure the standard of care these days for treating venous reflux is an endovenous ablation (ablation from inside the vein) technique  like the vnus procedure or evlt intense pulse light (ipl) is a great tool for treating very fine vessels  (1mm or less) or for venous matting (appearance of very fine mesh of red vessels in previously treated or traumatized areas) it will not work on larger vessels generally speaking  and definitely not for bulging leg veins
8829,asthma can be mild asthma is defined as reversible bronchoconstrictrion  this can be mild that it can only be detected by lung function test some asthma patients only realize their condition after a puff of albuterol  as they get use to a mildly reduce pulmonary capacity

8833,i i applaud your desire to have information before you arrive to the appointment a few questions would be helpful did you ever have symptoms in the past? any involvement of your eyes? was the positive csf oligoclonal bands or elevated igg index? the information you presented best fits with a monsymptomatic presentation as defined by the mcdonald's criteria which was designed to define those individuals who are likely to develop ms to secure the diagnosis you would need another clinical event or a change in your mri after 3 months they will probably want further testing including veps (visual evoked potentials) or oct (optical coherence tomography) the lab evaluation will include an ana  b12  folate  esr  vitamin d panel and routine labs they may also want a mri of the thoracic spine if the exam suggests spinal cord involvement good luck and well wishes
8834,lymph lymph nodes are sacks containing the bodies cells that fight infection and build up immunity these are the t cells and b cells the lymph nodes contain primarily t cells they are located in chains around the body set up to drain certain regions of the body the neck contains anterior and posterior cervical chains which is what your describing when drainage occurs and the material drained passes into and through the lymph nodeit is exposed to the cells mentioned above the cells recognise self and nonself substances if a substance is recognised as nonself then a stimulus process ensues this is clinically manifested by a swelling/tenderness along the chain both allergens and infective particles (ie pollen and bacteria) can cause the exact same swelling result the answer to your question is yesit is very very likely from your seasonal allergies and not staph or strep true infections such as these cause different symptoms!

8840,i i thought dr christensen's answer was spot-on  but i'd like to add my two cents in general  the presenting symptom of poor circulation is pain  not numbness numbness is a symptom of a nerve problem when you fall asleep on your arm and it feels numb and pins-and-needle-like  it's because you've compressed a nerve  not cut off the circulation when you have a heart attack  it's because an area of the heart muscle isn't getting enough oxygenated blood  and you feel pain people with poor circulation in their legs can't walk because of pain  not numbness (incidentally  diabetics who frequently feel numbness  burning  etc in their feet are feeling problems with how their nerves function it's not circulation that causes this) if you began feeling numbness in your calves right after your back surgery  i think it's a remarkable coincidence it's hard to believe you developed poor circulation right after having surgery on your back nerves that bring sensation from the legs to the brain have to pass through the spinal cord  and any compression to the spinal cord or nerve roots can cause all sorts of symptoms in the legs & feet as dr christensen explained  the nerves in your back could be responding to the swelling and trauma of being manipulated during surgery if so  this usually clears up in time when you say the pulse in one foot is slower than the other  i'm guessing you mean it feels weaker; less strong the best way to determine if you really do have an issue with circulation is to have plethysmography done  which is a simple  painless test to measure the circulation in your legs a vascular surgeon is the type of doctor who would do this if your circulation is fine and it's just the nerves in your back that are responding to surgical manipulation  you'll probably be fine in a few weeks if the symptoms persist  acupuncture helps this nicely good luck!
8841,you you have symptoms which are classic for gallstone disease and have been diagnosed with gallstones with what i assume was an ultrasound of the abdomen those are the only indications you need for surgery i would not wait until you have further symptoms or your symptoms worsen each time you have a gallbladder attack  you experience some chronic inflammation the more attacks you have  the more difficult it will make your surgery i would not waste any time

8846,the the most effective dental devices work by pushing the lower jaw forward  thereby opening the air passage behind the tongue most are custom made by dentists and are adjusted periodically to find the most comfortable and effective position for the individual patient some things to expect: dry mouth when it occurs is usually transient and can often be compensated for by simple changes to the appliance a small subgroup of patients has persistent dry mouth that is impossible to accept there are patients with sjorgrenâ€™s syndrome  medication side effects and other conditions that predispose them to dry mouth and there are many over the counter and prescription remedies available i have found two products that patients report great success with use the first is rinsinol by oral b it is not marketed as a product for dry mouth but as a product for treating oral ulcers but it provides excellent coverage of mucosal tissues the second product is a prescription item made specifically to treat oral mucositis associated with chemotherapy i use it in an off label method with amazing success the product is gel-clair and it comes packaged in a box of 21 small packages meant to be diluted with two tablespoons of water and rinsed around the mouth i found the product roughly equivalent to rinsinol when used in that fashion and very expensive i have many patients who use this product full strength and apply a small amount to their tissues and find it miraculous in how it controls dry mouth all night long an advantage to the off label method is one package can be used for several nights making it inexpensive to use it also works extremely well for oral ulcers in its undiluted form a problem frequently seen with oral appliances is pet dogs and cats have an affinity for eating  chewing and destroying them patients also are more likely to leave an oral appliance somewhere because it so small and does not require a special case bite changes are a more common phenomenon with oral appliances and are also easily reversible early on when the patient wears the appliance that keeps their jaw in a different position for eight hours healing occurs in joints and adaptation will often occur dentists usually give their patients exercisers or positioners to return to their original position patients are often not aware of the bite changes when patients are aware of the changes about 50% find them to be favorable it is rare to see a patient discontinue use due to the bite changes dentists are often more upset with the bite changes than the patients are there is also a subgroup of patients who experience tm joint problems or muscle pain when wearing appliances these problems are almost never a reason to not use oral appliances but they need to be addressed and treated by a dentist trained to deal with tmj disorders the remarkable fact is that 90â€“95% of oral appliance users report long-term satisfaction with their treatment the problems associated with appliance use are usually easily solved or well tolerated by patients many patients who start with treating their sleep apnea problems find that correcting the underlying tmj disorders an advantage not a problem similarly  many patients who start seeking treatment for tmj disorders find that they move on to treating their sleep problems because the underlying problems are the same it turns out that treating either problem usually helps both problems good luck!
8847,gallstones gallstones and their symptoms can be highly variable from one person to another many people can walk around and feel normal with gallstones  and they do not need surgery other people with gallstones get upper abdominal gas and pressure discomforts with nausea or vomiting if you hare having gallstone pain and symptoms  which usually get worse with eating fatty or greasy foods  then you should see you family doctor to see if they recommend referral to a surgeon probably also not the best to wait for severe unrelenting abdominal pain and vomiting to occur

9147,vertigo in general  significant vertigo with nystagmus is a problem with the peripheral vestibular system if less severe  nystagmus could be less if central vertigo an anatomically normal mri is reassuring but that test does not assess the function of the system formal testing by vestibular specialists is often recommended and sometimes then rehab make sure the mri reading is good  also

9513,unrelated the sore on the scalp is likely unrelated to the stomach ache  headache and sore throat (fungal infections of the scalp do not usually cause these distant symptoms) his doctor can help you sort this out
9514,try benadryl and form good sleep habits such as going to sleep at the same time every night to get your body into a routine
9515,a nerve problem can be divided into sick nerves and compressed nerves you can then look at the distribution (one tiny  tiny area) sick nerves go from the ends backward; they are due to overall processes like diabetes and as such hit more than one area typically tight shoes cause temporary numbness in a small area this is a typical distribution for high heels cannot say in your particular case  but generally 
9516,look for diphenhydramine which is the generic of benadryl they should know what that is/have it there if you try zyrtec  take 10mg daily best of luck!
9517,be seen the combination of a bulky uterus and a fibroid is causing excessive bleeding and will cause your blood to be dangerously low be seen and all the best
9518,get checked swollen tonsil  which can cause ear pain when swallowing  and bad breath is often a sign of strep throat  which must be treated with antibiotics so you don't get complications later please get seen or call your doctor
9519,more than 1 reason when ovarian cysts pop  it may cause pelvic pain between periods however  i would advise seeing an ob/gyn to make sure you are up to date with your pap/pelvic and evaluation for uterine fibroids or endometriosis
9520,tonsil stones your symptoms suggest tonsil stones  also called tonsilloliths or calculi or they may be concretions in the tonsillar crypts any throat sore throat symptoms? if so  you may use salt water gargles (1/2 tsp per 1 cup water) several time daily  or otc sore throat lozenges in themselves  these tonsil stones are not a concern  except that they may be a cause for halitosis hope that helps
9521,numbness &amp; tingling sounds like carpel tunnel syndrome consult your medical doctor or an orthopaedic hand specialist
9522,more in women several reasons: urethra is much closer to the anus  it is shorter in females  and women don't have the prostate secretions which stops the bacteria also sex makes the female more prone however in elderly  roughly same in both because of prostate enlargement and urinary obstruction in male
9523,need an exam nausea and diarrhea most often is due to a viral gastroenteritis but left sided abdominal pain suggests the possibility of another cause you need to be seen and examined by a physician to make sure nothing serious is causing your symptoms and to prescribe treatment
9524,seasonal flu that vivera (essix) be changed every 3-6 months however  many orthodontists suggest with good care  vivera's should last 12 to 18 month take care
9525,needs evaluation 1 in 9 american women get breast cancer i would recommend a breast exam by your obgyn and a mammogram with a breast ultrasound if your breasts are dense it is good the heart is cleared it is most likely fibrocystic breasts which cause pain and is worsened by caffeine i like you thinking to always rule out the worst possibility
9526,x-ray possibly requires an x-ray to evaluate the size and nature of bump
9527,unrelated occipital lymph nodes drain the basin of your scalp and maybe auricular area it may be that you just noticed this lymph node and it was enlarged for sometime have your doctor do a thorough exam of your scalp and looking for abnormal moles it is unlikely but melanoma in your age group can be hidden in hair painless lymph node
9528,it depends on the result of the thyroid (hopefully tsh) blood test their are many reasons for fatigue and muscle pain
9529,parts of a cbc cbc or complete blood count includes these things hemoglobin and hematocrit measure red blood cells low levels mean anemia the others describe red cell shape  color and size to help your doctor find the cause of anemia  if it is present the m is for mean  the c is for cell (or concentration)  v is volume  h is hemoglobin rdw is rbc distribution width
9530,1-4 weeks i usually proceed with the second eye 1-4 weeks after the first  as long as the eye is healing well and the patient is happy!
9531,nerve pain if it is the inside of your ankle you may have irritated the nerve  or you may have a strain of the ligament
9532,yes ocular irritation is normal in the days following surgery this should gradually improve and can be helped with over-the-counter pain relievers (ask you retina specialist first) if the pain is severe or does not lessen in time  it may be a more serious issue ask your retina specialist
9533,not always however we do worry about nodules with calcification more than other nodules as a significantly higher rate of being malignant
9534,genetic testing perhaps  yes but  before you do the test  you should have a detail discussion re - what is your risk for certain cancers-  what kind of genetic testing needed  how to interprete the result   what the consequencies of the test are etc- those above are things you should discuss either wih your oncologist or with a genetic counsellor discuss with your oncologist in detail
9535,sexually transmitted it is highly unlikely to catch the high risk human papilloma virus that increases the risk for cervical dysplasia or cancer by any means other that close sexual contact unfortunately  it can be spread through vaginal  oral and anal sex be careful  always use a condom  and get vaccinated against high risk hpv if you qualify current approved ages are 9-26 years old in both males and females
9536,many possibilities gallstones can run in families  more common in women  more common in women who have had childbirth  and in some ethnic populations as some indians and south and central american populations there is question of elevated cholesterol and gallstones more common in people who have had heart surgery or other major operation also in those who lose a lot of weight quickly
9537,new symptoms you should let your doctor know might not want to take a triptan medication or an ergot preparation until you get seen there may be increased risk of stroke due to excessive vasopsasm of one of the vertebral arteries
9538,fibula fracture generally speaking no displaced fractures can be casted for 4-6 weeks if the fracture is however noted to be unstable or in combination with other injuries that would render instability  surgery may be indicated
9539,take claritin since u have no fever   i think it is allergies
9540,no if complications of the surgery arise during travel or overseas   not a safe idea
9541,not necessarily multinodular goiter (mng) is enlargement of thyroid gland with multiple cysts and nodules sometimes diagnosed by physician on physical exam or patient complaining of neck mass non toxic (mng) do not produce excess thyroid hormone toxic mng proudce excessive hormone with sxs of hyperthyroidism ultrasound can define types of nodules sometimes if nodule larger than expected us guided biopsy
9542,yes current guidelines recommend the use of statins for diabetics with a ldl of greater than 100 an optional goal of decreasing the ldl to less than 70 is usually set for those at particularly high risk
9543,mcdonald criteria we look for dissemination in space  or lesions both in different areas of brain  but also spinal cord  and dissemination in time  presence of both old and newer lesions mri patterns as above can confirm the diagnosis
9544,see another doc! heme pos stool may be from a polyp  removable by colonoscopy  or other benign source colonsocopy may be possiible for you without sedation  if that is what worries him/you  and there are many other possible sources for your heme + stool that may not require surgery the ostrich technique (burying your head in the sand so the problem will go away!) is rarely helpful in this case ct colonography
9545,? i would first get evaluated to see how much ligament damage you have x-ray  mri ligaments can heal without surgery if damage is too sever you may need surgery
9546,probably not fish oil is quite popular now   research at some of the leading health research hospitals have determined that all oils  fish  olive  etc cause endothelial dysfunction in blood vessels this may not be an important issue for everyone  however certainly would be for those with several other risk factors for atherosclerotic plaque formation include more fiber- whole grains  fruits & vegetables
9547,yes while treatment of bipolar disorder with lithium has lessened over the past few decades  it is because newer medications with fewer side effects have become available in many instances  these newer medicines work very well sometimes  lithium is still the best and most effective treatment  and should definitely be considered an excellent choice
9548,dementia alzheimer's and vascular dementia often co-exist  and treatment is very similar for both both have cognitive/memory dysfunction  but the progression with vascular dementia is more stair-stepping down than alzheimer's  which is more gradual dementia from a single large stroke looks different than from small-vessel disease possibly more frequency of depression with vascular dementia
9549,potentially brca tx may include chemo  hormones  radiation  bone targeted tx & diet/exercise as adjvuant (post surgery) treatment the combo needed depends on the tumor characteristics (grade  stage  hormone receptor status - er  pr; and her2/neu status) non chemo tx can include hormones - eg tamoxifen  arimidex  etc; trastuzumab (herceptin - anti her2 antibody) optimal therapy may include all those
9550,see your doctor these extra symptoms are just more severe migraines migraines are the body's warning system something is stressing you that is making your migraines more complex you may have infection  allergic reaction  toxic reaction to food or drug  or some emotional crisis you need a good medical checkup
9551,not usual for disk with the muscular atrophy and neuritis  it might be best to undergo further testing there are many possible causes  including diabetes  autoimmune  endocrine  to mention a few at your age  a complete workup is indicated
9552,uae options are uterine artery embolization or hysterectomy oral analgesics or bcp have also be of help
9553,other ways to check for gout would be elevated uric acid in blood and by way of 24 hour urine tapping the joint is the definitive way there are reasons the tap could be negative  however  i would advise a rheumatology work up with complete bloodwork to rule out causes other han gout
9554,rarely virtually all stones can be visualized by ct scanning  except for the very rare indinavir stone prior to the widespread use of ct  stones that do not show up on x-ray films  like uric acid stones  were called radiolucent ct scanning is much more sensitive for the detection of stones than an ultrasound  and it is unlikely that stone visible on ultrasound is not seen on ct
9555,no that will not happen
9556,i think any guess is really conjecture without seeing having said that  you can try a topical steroid and if no improvement see the dermatologist
9557,different tests you had a thyroid ultrasound which evaluates the anatomy of your thyroid gland to find out if a thyroid nodule is hot or cold you need a nuclear thyroid scan aka i-123 uptake and scan this latter is a functional test of your thyroid and characterizes nodules as hot  cold or warm (isointense) however  a 3 mm nodule is likely to small to characterize with a nuclear thyroid scan
9558,follow dr directions you are already under care of a doctor who has been doing the work up if you had fluttering and chest pressure  you have to complete cardiac work up good luck
9559,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
9560,migraines? you may be experiencing a migraine you can try excedrin migraine (contains aspirin  acetaminophen  caffeine) there are other prescription meds that might also help
9561,no but you are concerned make an appointment with your family dr
9562,possibly evaluate at age 22 yrs   probablility of symptoms are most commonly not cardiovascular usually gastrointestinal  pain may be colicky  and peptic ulcer disease/gb (unusual) must be suspected however  myocarditis  and other unusual cardiovascular disorders must be considered by lab and ecg investigation
9563,not normal in men though urinary tract infections commonly occur in women; since the urethra in men is longer and farther from the anus  uti's in men aren't common however  uti's in men all require a work-up to find the underlying cause so it can be addressed: 1sexually transmitted infection  2anatomical/physiologic cause (bacteria backwashes)  or 3obstruction causing urine retention( eg enlarged prostate)
9564,maybe zyrtec makes some people sleepy they basically work the same but benadryl works for just a few hours and usually causes more sleepiness may want to try allegra (otc generic is fine) in morning if zyrtec causes sleepiness
9565,see below since the bone was not totally immobilized you may have had some motion at the fracture site caused bone callous formation this should decrease byt may take up to a year
9566,may not help prescribing clomid alone for infertility when ovulation is not an issue may not improve the chances of conception in fact higher dosage of clomid may actually decrease the ability to conceive at high dosages of clomid the cervical mucus becomes thicker and the lining of the uterus becomes thinner impacting conception
9567,tincture of time typically  antibiotic treatment is the best option to settle inflammation or drainage from an inflamed or infected sebaceous cyst once the inflammation has settled the best option is surgical excision of the lesion
9568,needle aspiration only aspiration or re excision both with a rate of recurrence
9569,probable middlesmert it sounds like you have a functional hemorrhagic ovarian cyst and have experienced middlesmertz (ovulation pain) – i’d consult your gyn and confirm with repeat us to be safe!
9570,yes any bug bite that is worsening with painful  nodular changes should be evaluated especially with history of systemic lupus erythematosis auto-immune diseases can complicate treatment as well as produce worsening long term morbidity with this history
9571,yes swimming is great exercise for everyone! the basic problem with osgood schlatter's is that the child is rapidly getting taller and the musculo-skeletal system is a little behind in keeping up non weight-bearing exercise like swimming is not going to be detrimental
9572,very likely the hsv1 virus will nearly always transmit through sexual contact either oral or genital
9573,itchy red spots what you describe sounds like eczema? this is a dry patches of skin from too much skin exposure to the weather and water and soap use cortisone cream to the spots three times a day and avoid a lot of outside skin exposure and excessive washing
9574,often times a simple surgical shoe may suffice or even a camwalker without any cast ultimately  it is the decision of the treating doctor
9575,not likely one factor is family history of this disease  like if a sister and mother also had it these cancers are hormone dependent  so early menarche  late menopause  and late/no term pregnancies are at increased risk dietary fat intake may also be a risk factor but the environment you lived in is highly unlikely to have done this more likely is that you should've seen your dr so see dr asap
9576,staph infection by your description i am presuming your bf had an abscess which is being treated with abx usually seven to ten days of antibiotics suffices
9577,no and yes there is a blood test that we use in colon cancer  however it is not advised for screening there can be colon cancer without bleeding only 25% of colon cancers present with bleeding
9578,no glasses will not change the shape of the cornea but proper glasses and good vision are essential for proper vision development
9579,sensative caffeine is a vaso constrictor (makes vessels smaller) you may be very sensitive to caffeine or you may be taking in more than you should (too much coffee in one day) i would reduce my caffeine intake and be aware that you may get a headache from not taking in as much as you used to tea has less caffeine and you might try tea if you need the caffeine
9580,time not level as dr depietro said  keeping your inr beteen 2 and 3 while you take coumadin is important but how long you stay on coumadin depends on a number of factors that aren't determined by your inr
9581,secondary lymphedema the swelling is caused by secondary lymphedema if you see a lymphedema therapist who can do manual lymph drainage and complex decongestive therapy - a special wrapping of legs swelling will go away within a week
9582,wateriness the watery eyes are not related to the prior cataract surgery dry eye is very common i would try artificial tears frequently during the day  ointment at night  warm compresses 1-2 times a day  and omega-3 fatty acid supplements if no improvement  see an eye doctor
9583,avoid phytoestrogens fibroids are a result of high estrogen levels high estrogen can be caused by excessive carbohydrate intake (via competetive inhibition of glucoronidase enzyme) therefore a low carb diet is beneficial to reduce estrogen and help shrink fibroids you may also have low iodine  thyroid problems  low progesterone all of these things should be evaluated all phytoestrogens should be avoided
9584,neuropathy perioperative trauma or non healing fracture or ligament sorain cause
9585,possibly i would recommend discussing this in detail with your medical oncologist being a stage one it is unlikely that chemo will be required as long as the tumor has been adequately removed surgically stage one breast cancer is a potentially very curable stage with the proper treatment
9586,common to get some scar tissue in the upper part of the lung just below the ribs this is often best appreciated on a ct scan most patients have no change in their breathing function  and the risk of developing a temporary inflammation (pneumonitis) is very low  but treatable with steroids this risk is probably lower with modern radiation techniques such as imrt
9587,maybe pet/ct scan is a very sensitive test and may very well find additional sites of disease however  its sensitivity varies depending on the cancer histology and size of tumors unfortunately stage 4 means that the disease is advance and metastatic finding additional sites of disease may not significantly change the treatment plan and therefore may not be of additional help
9588,cyst th can be anything from a chalazion to a foreign body reaction to a bug bite to just a slow growing benign cyst you should be seen and evaluated by an ophthalmologist
9589,sinus surgery balloon sinuplasty - minimally invasive technique  uses a small balloon inflated to widen blocked passages  generally has less bleeding and shorter recovery time endoscopic sinus surgery - uses a small camera to visually examined the sinuses tiny surgical instruments inserted to remove obstructive tissues  does not require any incision as the whole procedure is performed through the nostrils
9590,yes odds are less because only 1 tube  but yes indeed you could
9591,not normal these are typical signs of sleep apnea  a condition which involve periods of ten seconds or more without breathing (apnea) and periods of time with shallow breathing and a significant decrease in blood oxygen levels (hypopnia) this condition can be diagnosed by a sleep specialist with either an overnight at home sleep test or at a sleep clinic
9592,good values these are all excellent the hdl is nearest to abnormal at 43 (threshold is 40) best to keep an eye on it  maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly i assume that you do not smoke and have normal blood pressure
9593,maybe i recommend you see an oral surgeon for a consultation for your wisdom teeth you may need to have your wisdom teeth extracted consider sedation for your comfort
9594,swollen feet very unlikely
9595,no droop lip the nerve damage after a wisdom tooth is extracted is called a paraesthesia it could be temporary and healed after several months however it could be permanent it usually does not result in droopy lip
9596,it depends the american colloge of ob/gyns recommends women who retain their cervix after hysterectomy  or those who don't but have a history of severe pre-cancer of the cervix  should continue to have pap smears
9597,see below these are symtoms that need to be evaluated thoroughly your physician he/she will be able to discuss his/her findings and suggest a plan
9598,see a doctor your are obviously sick with some sort of viral or bacterial infection sinus pressure  headache  nasal congestion  sore teeth  are all symptoms of a sinus infection is there a color to you nasal discharge? you should go to to a doctor who could prescribe some medication to help you
9599,sure the most effective lifestyle modifications to increase hdl cholesterol include exericse  omega-3 fatty acids  a low glycemic diet  stopping smoking  a possibly a serving of red wine daily (depending on the person)
9600,depends how much does it affect you activities of daily living? if it is bad and you feel it is worth 1 in 100 to 5  000 risk at having problems to function better  then yes i would have surgery if it is not that bad  then wait for now  you can opt for surgery at any time in the future as long as the cataract is not causing other medical problems with the eye (inflammation or glaucoma)
9601,in another question you mention you suffered an injury of a fellow cheerleader landing on your foot - not sure why you keep repeating the same question you injured it  now go see a doctor to take care of it
9602,variable it can be temporary or permanent you should make your doctor aware of it at your follow up appointment/
9603,nasal saline spray sorry to hear about all the symptoms have an md evaluate you ocean nasal spray or a humidifier works well hope you feel better
9604,see doctor again there may have been more to the injury than the doctor originally thought have it re-evaluated and get another x-ray sometimes things are more obvious at a later date!
9605,yes scaphoid fractures are sometimes difficult to visualize on x-rays  especially initially after an injury if you have tenderness at the base of your thumb near the wrist  it is reasonable to splint or cast the wrist until follow-up x-rays confirm the absence of any fracture occasionally  an mri study can be useful to rule out a scaphoid fracture definitively
9606,infected post-op amoxicillin is a very common and inexpensive antibiotic for oral infections the infection following wisdom teeth extractions usually involve the bony socket requiring a strong antibiotic to control there are several other antibacterial medications  like keflex or clindamycin  that can be switched to if the infection lingers i would advise drinking more fluids to flush the body of toxins
9607,myopia treatment myopia and astigmatism result from an eyeball that's misshapen the only cure is to reshape it with lasik or lasek it's not like exercises or vitamins will ever work because it's not due to weakness or a nutritional deficiency
9608,it can be aspirated assuming that the mass is actually a ganglion cyst  it can often be successfully aspirated or sucked out with a needle unfortunately  the cyst often recurs after aspiration the only way to truly remove the cyst is with surgery
9609,depends if your surgery was uncomplicated  then the retinal hole is likely not related to the cataract surgery
9610,blood glucose level hi  your blood glucose results reveal normal levels if your family history is positive for diabetes or you have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy  you may be at greater risk of developing diabetes later avoid simple carbohydrates and empty calorie foods eat a diet with lots of protein  fiber  complex carbs   and small amount of good fats  exercise regularly and see your pcp annually
9611,no fibroids cannot be cured by homeopathy; large fibroids can cause pressure on the bladder which might lead to frequent urination; however i would recommend urine culture to rule out infection (uti) large or symptomatic fibroids need to be treated early; do not delay treatment because they will not go away on their own
9612,nerve can regenerate as a dentist  who had a similar experience after a different dental surgery (apicoectomy)  i can relate that after 3 5 years the feeling began to return as tingling and progressed to itching and finally today i have totally normal feeling back in my lip it is almost like when you get dental local anesthesia where you are totally numb and when it is wearing off  you get a tingling feeling
9613,cycle length? need to tknow how long between periods which is called 'length of menstrual cycle' you ovulate 14d before the period starts so if your cycle is 28 days  then you probably are not pregnant as the egg lasts ~72hrs and sperms ~48hrs
9614,inclusion cyst you are describing a inclusion cyst not likely cancerous but removal is appropriate
9615,perhaps talk to your podiatrist or orthopedist if immobilization ( a cast  cam walker) and/or offloading (crutches) may be needed your doctor can talk about your treatment options
9616,it depends it is safe to live with uterine fibroids under certain conditions: #1) they don't cause severely abnormal bleeding or debilitating pain  2) they do not grow rapidly  and #3) are limited to being less than approximately 14 weeks' size (i e appproximately the size of a 14 week pregnant uterus) the vast majority of fibroids are benign they can sometimes interfere with getting or staying pregnant
9617,warm compresses for superficial vein thrombosis  try warm compresses  systemic anti-inflammatory such as naprosyn  and topical anti-inflammatory such as aspercreme
9618,they're not uncommo meniscal tears are common when you say you had another tear on the other side  i think you are referring to the medial versus lateral meniscus as opposed to right versus left side this additional tear may or may not be causing your symptoms the best way to know is to be evaluated by an orthopaedic surgeon familiar with knee problems your original surgeon may be a good place to start
9619,no clots usually cause swelling in the calf see your doctor if it doesn't improve within a week
9620,yes depending on size and composition stones might not be visible by x rays  see your doctor for persistent pain
9621,hopefully you shouldgoback to the doctor that did the surgery and have it re-evaluated hopefully it was worse shortly after your surgery
9622,no get the hernia fixed and start working out! take control of your health
9623,healing problems lasik is elective the tear film contains multiple protective parts these aid healing and minimize inflammatory and infection effects the drier the eyes the more risks for bad problems to develop
9624,avulsion treatment is aimed at eliminating weight bearing to allow the fracture to heal it may even need surgery early or later depending on the severity of the fracture or how healing progresses see your podiatrist for guidance
9625,maybe if the metastatic disease to the chest is minimal or only in lymph nodes a ct scan of the chest may be more sensitive to detect it compared to a chest xray
9626,moderately ct scans are good at diagnosing large tumors and other common intra abdominal problems vaginal ultrasound is much better at visualizing the ovaries and the uterus
9627,interchangeable pulmonary fibrosis is a pathologic description of interstitial lung disease which is a radiographic description of the disease the terms are used interchangably but not all interstitial lung disease results in pulmonary fibrosis
9628,lasik if you are having trouble with your vision  you should see alasik surgeon to determine the cause if you had monovision treatment  you should not need glasses for most of your activities
9629,that that actually is not entirely true laser vision correction procedures are quite good at reducing moderate amounts of astigmatism the laser i use (amo visx s4) is capable of correcting up to 3 diopters of myopic astigmatism and  from personal experience  is quite accurate in this regard for people with mixed astigmatism it is actually approved for up to 5 diopters of astigmatism if your astigmatism is 3d or less then laser vision correction surgery could very possible be an effective way to correct your vision
9630,chemoembolization chemoembolization is a good option for patients who are not candidates for other therapies  but it is not a good choice when liver function is poor in general  we don't do chemoembolization in patients with bilirubin levels above 3 0  baseline encephalopathy  or ast or alt levels above 100 (unless the patient has hepatitis  in which case 100 is not too bad) blood clotting issues are usually correctable and should not impact the plan to do chemoembolization chemoembolization is not considered curative  but rather palliative that means that it slows the tumor down  which may help to keep the patient within acceptable limits for transplantation external beam radiation is not usually used in liver cancer because the normal liver is more sensitive to radiation than the tumor is on the other hand  it is often possible to do internal radiation with a technique called selective internal radiation therapy (sirt)  also known as radioisotope embolization this technique can be used in patients with very compromized liver function and appears to be very effective here are the names and phone numbers of two doctors in arizona who use the sirt technique: charles k raker  md - (602) 239-4622 phoenix  az - dept of radiology banner good samaritan hospital william j romano  md  fsir - (480) 440-9784 phoenix  az - mdig/vip
9631,dry dry eyes can be caused by numerous things a complete eye exam is necessary to determine the causes usually artificial tears  lid hygiene  and even changing the type of contact lenses may help reduce your eye irritation contacts made out of material allowing good flow of oxygen to the surface of the eye is highly recommended also  if all the above fails  consider placing punctal plugs in your eye to reduce dry eye symptoms http://wwweye-socalcom/eye-care-information/191-eyelid-how-is-dry-eye-treated-with-punctal-plugshtml
9632,typically typically eye surgeons like to wait until patients are 21 years old before performing refractive surgery you have a couple options that work well  including lasik and prk also  your refractive error should be stable and not changing because you live in socal  i encourage you to meet with dr melton  a cornea and refractive surgery specialist  at eye associates of southern california (wwweye-socalcom) dr melton is outstanding
9633,see your pediatricia lactose intolerance means difficulty digesting milk sugar dairy allergy means an allergy to milk protein patients could have both problems a 4 mo old more likely has milk allergy a soy based formula may be the answer speak to your pediatrician
9634,yes it is uncommon  but it happens it is unknown exactly why  but there is an increase association of bladder cancer in young patients with augmentation (bladder and intestine are surgically combined to increase bladder storage) bladder cancer is still a very uncommon disease in a young person bladder cancer risks: smoking  industrial dyes  parasitic infections
9635,protection the old adage that states that when you go to bed with someone  you are in bed with everyone they have ever had sex with is actually accurate if you were both previously virgins then there is no issue unfortunately  in many stds  there is an asymptomatic carrier state- people can have illness without symptoms condoms protect both of you i suggest condoms for 6 months plus monogamy
9636,there are other q options to consider before hysterectomy and most are incompatible with those desiring future fertility endometrial ablations are one option a mirena iud can help reduce menstrual flow uterine artery embolization is another option but not all patients are good candidates depending on the location of their fibroids speak to your doctor but all options r availble w/ hysterectomy being definitive
9637,uncommon macular edema and corneal abrasion are uncommon after cataract surgery and require additional therapy see your eye surgeon
9638,you you should have nerve conduction studies please specify if the numbness is at the top of your foot or at the sole
9639,laser eye surgery laser eye surgery can correct most amounts of myopia and astigmatism as long as you are otherwise a good laser candidate both lasik and prk can treat these refractive errors and are equally effective long term
9640,clear lens removal clear lens extraction or lensectomy can correct both myopia and astigmatism if a toric lens implant is used it is same procedure as cataract surgery and is very safe if you are young  there is a long term risk of retinal pathology after surgery so you may want to see a retinal specialist prior to clear lens extraction surgery
9641,yes your brain and your body need to rest and rejuvenate which it happens during sleep
9642,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
9643,need need more info- do you have a kitten?
9644,nocturnal nocturnal ( nighttime) numbness and tingling and pain in the hand can be associated with carpal tunnel syndrome while diabetes can give peripheral neuropathy typically the tingling associated with diabetic neuropathy will affect both hands equally as well as the feet however with diabetes or any other systemic problem that can affect nerves and circulation  the presence of the underlying disorder can worsen the symptoms of carpal tunnel when it gets worse this also means that diabetes sometimes prevents the pain form occurring early on and when it does occur may feel worse suddenly nonetheless the reason carpal tunnel seems to be worse at night when sleeping is several fold 1  the pressure on the nerve is increased by the increased tissue pressure form lying down  the fluid that sits outside the cells redistributes itself to the face and upper extremity when someone lies down ( its why feet are swollen at the end of the day and the face feels puffy and fingers stiff in the am) this extra fluid increases the pressure on the nerve a second thing that often occurs when one sleeps unsplnted is that the wrists flexed or extended  also putting more pressure on the nerve the pressure builds  the fingers go numb  pain follows and finally the pain build enough to awaken the sufferer to start  a simple wrist splint may suffice to help with the night time symptoms not too tight as that can cause pressure on the nerve too defeating the purpose next antiinflammatories  otc non steroidal antiinflammatories but if someone is a diabetic taking other medications then they should always check with their pcp/family doctor/internist or endocrinologist before taking nsaid' s as the y can have a deleterious effect upon renal ( kidney) function a pcp may prescribe antiinflammatories as well injections of corticosteroids are often used acutely by hand surgeons for non operative care a nerve conduction study and emg can help define/delineate the role of carpal tunnel v  neuropathy start with a pcp and consider seeing a hand surgeon once the work up is initiated  
9645,be be patient and wait for the reading from the radiologist don't make your own diagnosis
9646,autonomic autonomic neuropathy can indeed give bowel and bladder problems along with peripheral neuropathy there are tests that would be done by a urologist to evaluate the nature of your bladder dysfunction a neurologist would do an electromyographic study to evaluate peripheral nerve function if you are diabetic or prediabetic you may be developing neuropathy while ms can cause bowel and bladder problems during the course of the disease  it doesn't usually cause peripheral nerve involvement your neurologist will probably request an emg test along with autonomic testing
9647,this this definitely sounds like a problem of decreased blood flow in all likelihood  you have an arterial narrowing or blockage in your pelvis or leg in many cases  these abnormalities can be treated easily using minimally invasive techniques you'll need to be examined by a vascular specialist and have some testing done in the meanwhile  it would probably be a good idea to start taking a baby aspirin every day (assuming you have no allergies to aspirin or history of ulcers or abnormal bleeding) this will reduce the likelihood of your arteries becoming completely occluded by clot
9648,yes this probably developed into an abscess you will need to go to your podiatrist to get this taken care of this is very routine and will be done in the office they will numb your toe and remove the side of the nail and clean out the infection good luck
9649,not teething teething does not cause fluid filled bumps on the legs  arms  and tummy something else is going on here since he is only 18 months old you really don't know if he has any skin allergies or not he hasn't been exposed to that many things yet i think he needs to be seen by his pediatrian to figure out what is really going on
9650,sinus rinse try a sinus rinse with salt and warm watera plastic bottle is available at the pharmacy--he should do it twice a day for a month--it will help also no smoking and declutter his room--less chances of exposure to allergens
9651,hormonal hormonal therapy for appropriate tumors
9652,radiculopathy or pain from nerve compression can localize to one area  so a good evaluation of sensation  reflexes and strength is important  maybe with an mri find a good ortho spine doc to help you
9653,treat? cancer spread like this is not usually treated for cure  but to relieve symptoms always ask how is this going to help me  what are the side effects and more we have to ask: is it worth what it costs? i tell my patients these things  but often offer whether i would do it if it were me getting it done little benefit of xrt to liver/kidney  so use is puzzling
9654,headaches not likely  but get checked out by an ent physician
9655,a a rare cause of chest pain in this age group is anomalous coronary artery although typically this will be detected by an astute cardiologist  it might be worth bringing up in discussion
9656,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
9657,hopefully hopefully the doctor took a sample of your urine and sent it to the lab for a urine culture the reason this is done is to obtain identification and sensitivity results this means that the type of bacteria causing the infection will be identified and the antibiotics that will work to erradicate the bacteria will also be identified  a well as those that will not work i do not recommend you take amoxicillin i suggest you call the doctor and inform them of your continued symptoms hopefully the culture was sent and the appropriate antibiotic can be started if not then your doctor will likely send out a urine culture and start you another antibiotic and adjust accordingly good luck
9658,it can lung transplant for cf is an important life prolonging therapy but it exchanges one set of problems for another after transplant  there is risk of rejection of the transplanted lungs by one's own immune system requiring use of strong meds that suppress your immune system which then increases your risk of serious infections there are many facets to this - talk to your cf dr to discuss pros/cons
9659,get re-evaluated pain could be as a result of many different things one would need to do a thorough history and physical exam and possibly some laboratory and radiology exams to determine the exact cause you may have instability of the ankle if you have a tendency to repeatedly re-injury your ankle have it re-evaluated and voice your concerns
9660,plantar fasciitis i suggest an ultrasound which can be used to quickly make this diagnosis
9661,if if done properly  a blepharoplasty rarely increases dry eye you should discuss this with your oculoplastic surgeon (wwwasoprsorg) and consider punctal plugs
9662,hello  hello  i don't know if you have an std it sounds like you have continued vaginal itchiness for severe months  burning with urination and a cluster of lesions on your labia it would be appropriate to see your family doctor or gynecologist to get this evaluated since it has been going on for sometime without resolving the doctor can do tests at that time to ensure that you do not have a sexually transmitted disease
9663,beyojnd beyojnd what you have already done  the best thing you can do is to where the best eye correction in terms of glasses or contacts
9664,dermatological dermatological conditions are always difficult to diagnose without seeing them if they are new and itchy  then conditions such as hives should be considered if they are flat and scaly  a viral rash like pityriasis could be considered  these are usually reddish however if they have a clear vesicle (bubble) on top  then chicken pox should be considered consulting a physician for a rash on a child is always a good idea  so the best advice would be to have her doctor take a look at that
9665,i i do not know any other medical history from you  but if no medical contra indication   i would recommend genral anesthesia thanks
9666,dr dr fowler took the words right out of my mouth sudden onset of pain  redness  heat & swelling involving a big toe is the typical presentation of gout considering you have high blood pressure  and since non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen have the potential to cause fluid retention (and therefore raise blood pressure)  i would most definitely seek your doctor's advice on this hyzaar contains a thiazide diuretic that is well-known to raise uric acid levels if this is a gout attack you're having  it might be advisable to switch blood pressure medication to something else just as an aside  we no longer consider diet a factor in gout the three biggest offenders in precipitating a gouty attack are aspirin  beer and certain medications (like the one you're on) feel better!
9667,not not necessarily wisdom teeth extraction is a very traumatic process and it is very possible to have numbness for days or weeks almost all the time  your feeling will come back slowly if you are still numb tomorrow  go see your dentist he/she may prescribe a steroid to help the healing process the initial numbness from the dental anesthetic should last no more than 8 hours  but most last 4+ hours
9668,lazy lazy eye is generally permanent after the age of 11 or 12 if she is younger than this  i strongly encourage you to wear her glasses once the brain no longer wants the vision from an eye  that eye will never have the chance of better vision there is a window to teach the brain to use an eye vision could get worse  but more importantly it will never get better
9669,sleep apnea it would depend on the severity of the apnea on your sleep study if the apnea is not severe there is a dental device that you can use there is the option of surgery but its not as effective if the apnea is severe losing weight is important if you are overweight
9670,thank thank you for your excellent description of your problem i also love when there is a photo  however the link you provided didn't lead to a photo  but an error but from your description  i'd say you have an onychia  which is a little infection along the base of the toenail  probably from irritation during the run the typical scenario is a tiny blister forms from irritation with continued irritation  the blister breaks and bacteria invade to produce a small  localized infection it's not serious  and unless there is overt redness  heat and swelling or a pocket of pus  it will probably subside on its own (assuming you're in good health  not a diabetic  no poor circulation  etc) keep it covered with a band aid  especially when you run warm water soaks will help too if you keep getting this  you may want to get some roll foam to cover your toe while you run to prevent irritation to the area in rare occurrences  the nail needs to be removed to allow pus to drain  but this hardly ever is needed hope this helps happy running!
9671,the the propanolol reduces shakiness and fast heart beat that would get with low blood sugar you should still sweat and feel weak and find your sugar low  below 70 if you do go low follow your sugars closely and you should let the doctor know if you go low or if you must eat to avoid low sugars there are drugs that control diabetes well but do not cause low sugars see my post below on my blog site also  you might consider seeing another doctor perhaps you have endocrinologists in the area
9672,recommend recommend an evaluation by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon to determine the source of your jaw pain and to evaluate the third molars the two things are probably not related but both pose a potential problem for you long term the jaw pain could be due to a joint problem  muscle problem  or an infection
9673,if if symptoms are not improving or ameliorated within one week despite conservative measures such as a neti pot /sinus irrigation and decongestants  you probably should be seen if the pain is progressing  or the drainage is purulent ( malodorous and pus-like) you should be seen sooner for initiation of antibiotic therapy a neti pot will not treat an infectious cause for sinonasal complaints  it merely removes particulate and secretory matter  and often affords symptomatic relief for mild congestive/inflammatory symptoms
9674,sore throat could be strep throat  does your child have fever  headache  vomiting or sore throat?
9675,splint first the single most early effective thing to do os to wear a well fitting wrist splint at night ( not too tight!) using antiinflammatories helps but taken with food and try to take if ok with your obgyn and it dies not upset your stomach or cause other health issues and cleared by your ob gym a hand surgeon may be able to offer an injection which can elevate blood sugar a bit so get clearance

9679,it could be it sounds more like an injury where the joint capsule has been torn and the toe joint is unstable and crossing over the 1st toe
9680,reason for asking? first  hospitals aren't hotels you're a patient  not a guest most choices aren't yours to make second  why would they wanna check for a brain tumor in a 19-year-old? maybe you wanna check? it's not impossible  but the chances are mighty remote that they'd be concerned about it i suspect it's safe to stop worrying  or failing that  at least find something else to worry about
9681,troubling these symptioms are troubling and suggest that there is some problem within your ankle joint or a tendon in the area see an orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon one in your area can be found at wwwaofasorg
9682,maybe calf pain that radiates down into the ankle could be a dvt but there are certainly muscular  ligamentous  and tendinous problems that can give you the same symptoms although swelling and redness certainly don't happen all the time with a dvt  there is probably a reasonable chance this is not a dvt as dr ryan said  though  the only real way to know is to get a scan
9683,magnesium if orthototics do not help  tendonitis may respond to prolotherapy cramps can be due to electrolyte imbalance consider magnesium and potassium supplementation  and drink lots of water between meals check my website for details on magnesium supplementation webpage: drfairchildorg

9685,complex not sure what you are asking  but would suggest a consult with a spine surgeon  and perhaps a physiatrist also  to point directions for rehabilitation if you have bladder complications currently  this needs immediate treatment  and perhaps a urologist may also be required do not delay
9686,need more testing your blood counts are abnormal it can be reactive to viral infections or a primary bone marrow or immune related condition you need to have some tests done including blood levels  viral tigers and may be more specialized testing  ask to be referred to hematologist
9687,no dvt filters are not for everybody generally not needed nowadays removable filters are recommended and put in  if conditions where anticogulation can not be immediately performed due to bleeding or other causes tpa is not needed in all cases either
9688,yes unfortunately there is a limit to the resolution of a chest x-ray small lesions can be missed in addition  a chest xray is just a 2 dimensional projection comparing desities of different structures if a tumor happens to overlap with another structure of the same density then you can't even see it a ct scan can give a higher resolution picture but even it can miss a tumor at times
9689,namanda is an nmda n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist  which may slow nerve damage
9690,cheap treatment yes get rid of the dog or cat!
9691,use supplements lasik can lower tear product or alter tear composition so the tears evaporate more readily treatment is by supplementary tears  and punctal occlusion with plugs flax seed oil ingestion can help there is nothing that actually increases tear volume in these circumstances
9692,plantar fascitiis does not have to be painful in the heel the fascia originates in the heel runs under the arch and inserts near the base of the toes so anywhere along it's course you could have pain try wearing an arch support
9693,it may take awhile the lip could be numb from the affects of local anesthetic injected while you were asleep  in which case it may be a day or so before it wakes up  the are could also be numb because of stretching and pressure on nerves while extracting the teeth in this case  it may be a longer time before the sensation returns  possibly months
9694,chest x-ray a chest x-ray can spot a lesion which maybe lung cancer additional test would be necessary to confirm cancer an echo is an ultrasound of the heart it would not directly show a lesion the lung is full of air which does not work well with echo
9695,see eye doctor your description sounds like thyroid eye disease or an orbital tumor other issues can present like this as well you need further evaluation to determine the exact cause  initiate proper treatment  and prevent permanent loss of vision

9699,see your doc macrobid is fine for a simple  uncomplicated uti however  if the infection is spreading to your kidneys  then you need a different antibiotic however  kidney pain (typically back pain) isn't sufficient to diagnose a kidney infection (pylonephritis) as you could simply be dehydrated if you have back pain and a fever/chills  see your doc right away
9700,floaters / flashing an acute onset of floaters / flashing is usually from a vitreous detachment  esp between ages 50 - 70 with a normal retinal exam  the floaters come from debris pulled away from the optic nerve  and flashing from the gradual pulling away of the vitreous from the retina this process continues for days - weeks until it has completed nevertheless  i would contact your doctor about being rechecked
9701,probably helpful early ambulation  within a couple of days  has clearly been shown to be beneficial as long as things are stable on your medications and running doesn't cause pain  it is ok to do as others have said  though  clear it with you own doctor first and don't forget your compression stockings
9702,muscle twitching muscle twitching occurs when individual fibers of the muscle spontaneously contract this is common after changes in exercise regimen  changes in blood chemistry  and changes in nerve supply it is very common when implementing newer exercises or with irregular exercise frequencies it is also common with changing the resistance in work outs
9703,not likely while lasik and laser eye surgery are fantastic options that can enable a person to have less depenedence on glasses or contacts  not all patients are candidates for these procedures also  personal preference still drives many patients to choose glasses or contacts over laser vision correction optometrists also play a role in the diagnosis and initial management of eye diseases
9704,low grade arthritis! i have many patients with ccps > 250 with minimal disease activity other indicators of disease activity more important than ccp titer are: albumin/globulin ratio higher the better and anemia hgb goes down with disease activity i would base treatment on disease activity  not the ccp tests crp and esr being normal are far more important in activity assessment  along with active synovitis!
9705,follow up ck sometimes ear infections do not clear up i recommend a follow up ear recheck
9706,slipped epiphysis this condition is usually seen in overweight children  primarily boys before you do any surgery have him loses few pounds if he is overweight
9707,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells/digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph everywhere for bad stuff like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
9708,flat feet? from a podiatric perspective that's what i'd look at other possibilities could include juvenile arthritic conditions
9709,essentially-no intraocular lenses are made of materials such as acrylic  silicone  or pmma  which are materials that are essentially inert and the body does not recognize or react with them however  if there are bacteria or other substances that make their way into the eyes along with the lens  the body can have a reaction against these

9715,? i am sorry to be dense but i am not sure what you mean by increased vascularity i also wonder which two lower saphenous veins you mean since there is only one saphenous vein that goes from the ankle to the knee the pasta probably has nothing to do with the issue i would recommend that you see a vein specialist for an evaluation so that you can understand exactly what is going on
9716,no due to skin cancer risks of tanning beds  i am in agreement with ben ferguson who states that there is no exposure to tanning beds that is safe or harmless  chemo or no chemo

9724,need more testing a noncontrast ct is a good screening exam for many conditions  but may not be as sensitive as mri you should be examined by a neurologist  and if he feels that it is warranted  a contrast mri study will afford a more precise diagnosis
9725,yes a fine needle biopsy or core biopsy may have a false negative- in other words- missed a cancer even if the biopsy is negative this is especially true if the mass is large and there is no way to sample the whole thing without its removal
9726,unlikely but  urine pregnancy tests can detect pregnancy two weeks after conception not before that or on first day of missed period  make sure you are in that time frame before you test and come to conclusions the symptoms are vague and can be presented in many situations
9727,joint dysfunction your left tmj likely has medial (to the midline) displacement of the cartilage disc this allows the joint to be further up in the socket  hence the jaw shift the noise is the cartilage disc snapping back into place when opening without examination the growth cannot be commented on  so a visit to dentist or dermatologist is warranted
9728,depends symptoms and your physical exam with your doc will determine your answer stones in gallbladder  dont necessarily determine a treatment plan if you have fever  vomiting  worsening pain get evaluated right away
9729,influenza influenza more likely than asthma--we are in the midst of an influenza outbreak--of course other illnesses are a possibility
9730,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well

9734,more likely viral you most likely have a viral syndrome i would first try conservative medical management lost of fluids to include water and juice you may take tylenol or acetaminophen up to a maximum of 3000 mg a day this with the assumption that you don't have any liver disease if your symptoms don't resolve within a week  follow up with your md to be evaluated good luck
9735,cervical spondylosis cervical spondylosis or degenerative changes in the cervical spine could account for all of your symptoms if the numbness has been present for more than a few weeks  i would suggest being seen by your primary care physician x-rays may be indicated depending on the results of your initial examination

9737,unlikelly to spread most people have had chickenpox and the ones who don't did not because they have been vaccinated thus  it seems highly unlikely that you would spread it in addition  it is not easy for someone to catch chickenpox from you- they would need to have direct contact with your lesions or liquid from the lesions it might be wise to wear a glove on your hand and keep your arm covered (long sleeves)
9738,i had arthroscopic k call your orthopedist asap  you might have infection for which you need an antibiotic and most importantly you might have a blood clot in the leg  you need venous ultrasound to r/o that out both conditions should be treated right away

9746,possibly the use of multiple anesthetics does not usually affect the bun/cr of a patient there are some anesthetic agents that do have an affect on kidney function  but not significantly another possibility for your elevation is due to dehydration check with your physician to keep an eye on these values and continue to follow up
9747,leave on if ankle fracture is in good alignment it is best to keep shoe on for taking shoe off may displace fracture important to elevate limb on pillows and ice behind knee numbness in toes may be due to swelling unless alignment off and putting pressure on nerves keep foot and ankle straight until help arrives good luck

10032,depends of swelling tedhose can help control leg swelling after total knee replacement if your postoperative swelling is under control  it would be fine to stop the tedhose

10047,apply ice see if an ace bandage helps if pain still present see an orthopedist
10048,rest ice elevation does not sound like a ligament injury given your symptoms also unlikely a fracture ice the knee twenty minutes on twenty off  elevate when resting  take an nsaid such as alleve or advil as directed  of course do not take if you cant medically such as allergy  if your on blood thinners  or have severe gastritis see an orthopedist if your symptoms are not improving in a week

10052,yes yes  they have sinuses too they can also get infected best wishes this reminds me of a funny comic drawing of a baby as having only two glands  the giant drool gland in the head and the giant poop gland in their abdomen certainly by the age of three the drool gland has receded and theres enough sinus airspace to become problematic :
10053,most likely its the pt tendon and needs to be seen try rest  ice  compression and elevation until you see a podiatrist
10054,plantar fasciitis you may have torn your plantar fascia in the middle of your arch this can be painful and last for months to yearssee a foot specialist for a diagnosisif this is what you have  certain sole inserts and supports  along with rest and lots of stretching can shorten the duration
10055,yes this is one of the most commonly prescribed and oldest treatments for bladder infection during pregnancy
10056,yes certainly this can occur and sometimes taking an antibiotic care suit is vaginal yeast infection get checked by your medical provider if you have symptoms
10057,sinusitis sinus infections usually produce more symptoms than you are describing  and they can be due to many underlying factors see an ent doctor to try and clear this problem  both in terms of finding out what is causing this and then treating it best wishes
10058,yes could be back especially if having unprotected sex could be another type of infection too like gardnerella see an md for exam
10059,bacterial vaginosis go get checked out by your gynecologist and have a pelvic exam done b c you might have a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis which is a change in the bacteria of your vagina it can be treated with antibiotics and is not sexually transmitted http:  mediphorstumblrcom post 106744949635 bacterialvaginosisislikebadbreathofthe
10060,see a doctor please have them checked by a doctor you can go to any medical clinic and have them evaluated  just to be safe
10061,concerned lymphadenopathy that persists is not normal and needs to be evaluated with biopsy and other tests please consult your family physician for proper evaluation and management several etiologies  some of them not benign
10062,enlarged enlarged lymph nodes or lymphadenopathy are very common lymph nodes are part of the immune system and enlarge with white blood cells to fight off infections when they detect a foriegn substance such as a virus or bacteria ever notice lumps in your neck with a sore throat usually these nodes shrink back down to normal size a few weeks after the infection is over  but can sometimes stay enlarged no one is quite sure why this happens  but its usually harmless other illnesses such as autoimmune disease or cancer can cause enlarged lymph nodes  but often multiple nodes are involved  they can get very large  keep growing instead of shrinking and are associated with other symptoms such as fever  chills  weight loss  rash  etc that being said  if you feel that the size of the node is impairing your ability to turn your head  you might want to see an otolaryngologist ear  nose and throat doctor for an evaluation they are typically the doctors that take out problem lymph nodes from patients necks and would be a good place to start for a second opinion good luck
10063,see your doctor sinus infections are often viral sinus blockage can also be caused by allergies or other noninfectious conditions none of these will improve with antibiotics you should see your doctor for reassessment to determine the best treatment if you have not improved with antibiotics
10064,big stone 10mm it seems to be a big stone  10mm stones do not pass on their own 4mm stone has 80% chance of passing and 5mm 20% 10 mm stone can not pass by itself and has to be removed surgically follow your doctors advice
10065,highly unlikely   it may pass  but its highly unlikely given its size and shape eswl or extracorporial shock wave lithotripsy may be done to smash the stone but it can result in bleeding and internal trauma so surgery might be the best option here best of luck
10066,unlikely sounds like ulnar tunnel syndrome
10067,disk disease cervical disk disease a pinched nerve could cause the numbness and a neck xray would be helpful as a start before worrying about ms the sinusitis may be a coincidence
10068,abnormal ana there are a lot of rheumatologic or autoimmune causes for an elevate ana you would have to corelate this with the clinical findings additional testing might be needed to confirm the diagnosis i recommend discussing this with your pcp
10069,nonspecific interpreting blood work can be a very tricky proposition each lab values needs to be interpreted within clinical context and in association with other blood tests elevated crp can sometimes be normal  other times it is a marker of inflammation elevated bilirubin may also be normal but sometimes can be indicative of blood or gallbladder dysfunction
10070,see details low c3 and c4 levels by themselves do not have much clinical significance they and your dna levels does not determine the activity of the lupus discuss these issues with your rheumatologist
10071,no the ana is there because of some other reason because its there does not mean you have lupus there are many other reasons to have a positive ana your evaluation by your physician can clarify
10072,see details low c3 and c4 are common in lupus and usually have no clinical implications they are seen in lupus patients with skin or kidney involvement if your kidneys are normal i would not worry
10073,neuropathy it would be nice to know if you are taking any medications neuropathy can be a symptom of many different problems  including but not limited to infection  metabolic diseasesdiabetes  medication side efffects  hormone imbalancesthyroid  mitochondrial dysfunction  heavy metal toxicity  other organic polutants  and autoimmune diseases good luck
10074,possible lupus or possible lupus or other connective tissue disease or vasculopathy to be considered
10075,probable the diagnosis of sle is based on clinical features plus supportive lab evidence you did not mention how high the ana titer was and thus a positive one has little meaning i believe you need to see a rheumatologist given all of your symptoms which may well be from sle but
10076,maybe the real question is should we treat you for lupus with godawful highpower medications when you probably dont have it people with a clinical picture like yours usually have all this stuff go away after a while get seen by a specialty dermatologist for the rash rosacea can mimic lupus ignore lowtiter anas think about getting back to that fitnessfocused lifestyle you had as a teen
10077,sle no it should not take more than a day or two after your history and physical exam by a doctor to get back the lab results which may aid in the diagnosis this should never take months you may want to discuss this with your doctor or find a second opinion
10078,disease activity i assume that the diagnosis of sle has been confirmed the concentration of c4 is much lower than c3 as c4 is ow normal  there is no deficiency when sle is active  c4 concentration may decrease because of it being used up by immune complexes in the blood when disease activity lessens  less c4 is being used
10079,sle hi  if these are all the symptoms that you have u still dont meet the criteria for sle u need 4 out of 11 criteria  u only have 2  ana and weakness  c3  c4 are not diagnostic just we follow them in sle to monitor the response to the treatment  ms  per se  may not cause the rise of cpk unless there is muscle wasting due to inactivity  the lyme doesnt fit the symptoms much although its not
10080,frustrating and confusing hope all the doctors have accurate information the labs and the history are suggestive but not diagnostic of any criteria for lupus is well estabilished doublle atranded dna is more diagnostic of sle
10081,frustrating and confusing hope all the doctors have accurate information the labs and the history are suggestive but not diagnostic of any criteria for lupus is well estabilished doublle atranded dna is more diagnostic of sle
10082,unlikely with isolated knee pain one should search for other causes
10083,it might ebv like many viruses can cause joint pain at times the pain may be associated with joint swelling the joint symptoms may last several weeks if they persist longer you must consider other possibilities
10084,yes it is common with acute mono to have tender swollen glands in the front and back of your neck
10085,mono sweats your symptoms are not likely tremors but are the rigors that go along with a temperature elevation from the infection take some tylenol or motrin and it should help remember  no contact sports while you are in the active phase of the mono usually this lasts for 30 to 40 days good luck
10086,no ebv does not produce tremor produces fatigue   fever   malaise   abdominal pain   sore throat   swollen lymph nodes
10087,no ive not seen any evidence that mononucleosis or ebsteinbarr virus infection can produce a false positive hiv test
10088,ebv this illness is seldom if ever manifested by acute arthritis and something else is likely to be going on at the same time get yourself fully evaluated hope this clears up quickly
10089,possibly your description is not the usual presentation for a blood clot but there is no way to make a diagnosis without an exam blood clots can have unusual presentations if you are experiencing pain in you legs  call your family doctor and discuss the situation with him
10090,you do not have it ebv infection will be serologically be positive within one week many other infections can mimic ebv
10091,you bet and sometimes more some of the worst sore throats i have treated were caused by the epstein barr virus sometimes strep hurts a lot  and sometimes strep doesnt hurt that much at all
10092,possibly sxs of strep throat can include: pain of throat large  red tonsils with white exudates small red dots on roof of the mouth swollen lymph nodes on neck fever  headache  rash  difficulty swallowing  fatigue or rash complications can include infection of middle ear  sinuses  tonsils  skin  blood as well as scarlet fever  inflammation of kidney glomerulonephritis  eventually rheumatic fever
10093,mono tests it sometimes takes a month or so to feel better after a mono infection you doctor can run an antibody test to ensure your antibody levels are good from the infection get this checked out soon you will be glad you did
10094,it depends   this likely depends on whether or not yore sure yove got mono if your doctor is sure yove got it  likely nothing more but if its a clinical diagnosis  a serology test to confirm the mono virus is likely best also yore unlikely to get better for a while as this can last for weeks before resolving best of luck
10095,flu season first diarrhea and nausea are in no way signs of pregnancy it is the flu season  so i would chalk this up to that second  if you were sexual during your ovulation and you are missing a period we no longer just sit and wonder  we go get a pregnancy test these are readily available everywhere  even in pennsylvania
10096,depends likely a viral gastroenteritis unless you have a history of ibs
10097,probably although not really flu  it is most likely an enterovirus infection it is very important to make sure he does not become dehydrated give him clear liquids  sips at a time if that is what he will take  and avoid milk if you are unable to keep up with his fluid losses  please go to the er or your doctor for assistance
10098,possible: c diff diarrhea and nausea are quite common after abdominal surgery but may be do in part to the antibiotics or pain medications if prolonged this could be a sign of clostridium difficile diarrhea and should be discussed with your surgeon
10099,possibly check a home pregnancy test  and if negative see your doctor for the loose stools perhaps another issue is causing the loose bowels good luck
10100,yes it is possible but you should have it looked into to see if its esophageal reflux as well
10101,these viruses can linger for a couple of weeks make sure you are eating a nutritious diet to allow your intestinal lining to regrow
10102,could be but that would be self limiting i have seen patients with symptoms like that going on for years it is nearly always due to lousy diet  particularly sugar and sweeteners i keep answering like this because the present standard american diet spell sad professor john yudkin wrote a book in 1973 called sweet and dangerous and is well worth getting out of the library it is a blockbuster
10103,still healing even though yove recovered from your gastrointestinal infection  some effects still remain it may take a while for the inner lining of the intestines to heal and for normal digestion to return during this time  you should increase fluid intake  eat bland foods and avoid alcohol  beans  fatty foods  raw veggies limit dairy products to yogurt  lactaid  a bit of cheese yoll be fine soon
10104,hard to say just the symptoms of abdominal pain can be due to intestinal  stomach  and indeed a viral infection i would see a doctor in person as there is so much on exam and history needed to help guide you good luck
10105,d and c you state that you had a d and c after you had a positive pregnancy test a d and c is where the doctor cleans out the uterus after a miscarriage or for other reasons
10106,no bleeding after ab if you had a surgical abortion early in the pregnancy  it is possible that you wont bleed much however  the lack of any bleeding and still having tender breasts could be signs that there is still a pregnancy or still pieces of placenta or other pregnancy substances in your uterus please perform a pregnancy test and see your doctor good luck
10107,late periods it sounds like you just had a late period  which can happen during your teen years when your body is balancing its hormones transitions like starting college or other stresses can also lead to changes in your cycle some of these factors may even lead to some women skipping a cycle or two each year it is good that you are keeping track
10108,no from the information you provided  you are not pregnant
10109,probably need an ultrasound to be sure
10110,yes blood tests detect lower levels of hcg than urine tests do duphaston will not have an effect on the hcg detection by blood or urine repeat blood hcg or urine testing in 7 days would confirm a pregnancy if there is one
10111,pregnancy questions i am not sure why you think you are pregnant and are testing so much you did not have intercourse your tests are all negative the more tests that are negative the more statistically impossible it becomes for them to be falsely so you are having your periods you are not pregnant
10112,hmm  well the negative test and fact that your period is now present would go against being pregnant it does sound as if you were pregnant though in the recent past miscarriages are more common than you would think  and maybe your body was not ready for pregnancy not definitively sure though  you need to see the gyn doctor as you need an exam to treat you either way best wishes  god bless
10113,may be did you have unprotected sex since your last period did you miss a period if yes to both  you should get a blood test for hcg you could do a home test if you are 45 days past the missed period if the result is negative  repeat the test 45 days after that use first morning urine and follow the instructions for the test carefully
10114,repeat pg test of course you could be pregnant  so run a 2nd pregnancy test
10115,repeat pg test of course you could be pregnant  so run a 2nd pregnancy test
10116,snoring snoring is annoying and may harm your sleep and the sleep of whomever shares your bed or even people in other areas of your home custom fabricated oral appliances hold the lower jaw and tongue forward to create more space increasing the airway space a specially trained dentist can help you determine if you are a good candidate for a custom made oral appliance
10117,sure about sa did you have a sleep test to measure whether you might have sleep apnea ore not there are several types of sleep apnea  and without a test  it is hard to determine if you have it or not snoring is another issue and there are dental mouthpieces that work well for snoring too of course  a dr should examine you there are several reasons a person snores weight problems  sinus  nasal  allergie
10118,sleep apnea could be sleep apnea  speak to your physician and specifically address these issues probably best to get a sleep study done
10119,many causes your problem could be caused by a number of conditions from asthma to sleep apnea to anxiety the best solution would be to see your primary care provider
10120,get it checked out seek medical help to determine to cause of your snoring typically a collapse airway is involved and today  a simple overnight take home sleep test can provide all the information needed to determine if a potentially life threatening  life shortening condition of obstructive sleep apnea may be at play do it  it may save your life
10121,sleep study i believe that a sleep study is in order often  if there is no diagnosis of sleep apnea  an oral mouthpiece may suffice in helping the snoring problem diminish or go away but sleep apnea can cause other health problems and can be life threatening your md do should be consulted first
10122,snoring 70% of the time  this is due to the soft palate vibrating against the back of the throat throat tissues can become lax over time with less elasticity  making snoring more common with age there can be resistance to breathing through the nose or mouth due to a variety of anatomic causes which restrict airflow  causing vibration nasal strips  snore guards  and better pillows can help see an ent
10123,possible sleep apnea snoring and daytime fatigue are typical symptoms of sleep apnea if you snore loudly and experience a lot of daytime fatigue and sleepiness then ask your doctor if they think a referral for a sleep study would be appropriate
10124,complex snoring is a complex issue  but very treatable in many cases see a sleep expert  or an ent surgeon for a more complete evaluation hope this helps
10125,first check bp the swooshing sound is made by blood flowing through arteries near your inner ear it can be normal  and if it bothers you  try playing music or the radio to distract your brain but be sure your blood pressure is normal
10126,urgent care you need to go to the er or your local urgent care center get off your feet you will need an xray rest  ice  compression  elevation light pressure ace bandage
10127,snoring get a good physical exam by a ent and sleep study or visit a sleep dentist to get fitted for a mouth piece all of the doctors will get you in the right direction
10128,snoring remedies avoid sleeping on your back  sew a tennis ball into a pocket on the back of a tshirt lose weight see and ent to be sure there arent any nasal obstructions take medication for allergies use breathe rite strips have a dentist custom make an oral appliance
10129,check sleep apnea asthma can be related to sleep apnea  have your physician refer you for a sleep test or find a dentist who has a home tester
10130,osa get also checked for obstructive sleep apnea and see allergist  if you have gerd gastric reflux it can contribute to your night asthma attacks
10131,sounds like strep throat or mono have your doctor take a look shouldnt be hard for him her by examining you
10132,yes yes it could be very well related to heart please consult cardiologist as soon as you can if the pain is getting frequent or worser in intensity consider going to er you r too young though but if you have high risk factors this could be very well cardiac related
10133,upper arm pain cardiac symptoms can be very vague and non specific  see your medical doctor to see if further testing needed
10134,see physician there may be a tumor or a heart condition that needs immediate attention  see a physician asap to get an evaluation to rule out a serious condition and get appropriate treatment
10135,many possibilities these problems can only be uncovered by a complete evaluation by a dentist experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of tmds another more serious possiblity is referred symptoms from a cardiovascular problem i urge you to seek help asap to rule this more serious problem out first
10136,referred pain if ear and throat infection have been ruled out by your ent specialist  referred pain from the dental apparatus would be first on the list tmd  muscle spasm or dental infection have to be ruled out next cervical neck pain can be referred to the ear and throat rarely laryngeal pain can be referred to the ear
10137,heart   neck problem should see your doctor asap to make sure your heart is ok as your symptoms are very typical for a heart attack although a heart attack is extremely rare in a 27 year old female neck problems causing a pinched nerve sometimes may cause similar symptoms
10138, drinking what and how much of it
10139,could be coming from your heart  so see a doctor or it could be a lung problem such as infection or pulmonary embolus dont take any chances  go see a doctor
10140,if you had those tests  you have to believe in them if not satisfied with your own md  get a second opinion
10141,musculoskeletal l arm pain between shoulder and elbow is most often due to the muscles and bones and nerves located between the shoulder and elbow see your regular doctor if this is progressing or troublesome
10142,possible if the onset is acute  the degree  duration  and interval of left flank pain is highly variable  one has to watch for and think of possible urinary stone passage so  see local urgent care as needed best wish
10143,pd and dysautonomia a variant of parkinsons has dysautonomia as a feature a parkinsonian syndrome known as multiple system atrophy has significant autonomic system dysfunction
10144,possible unfortunately parkinsons is a spectrum on which your disease could be on and for which the treatment could be the same continue follow up with your neurologist
10145,integrative doctor if you been to mayo clinic  and they cant find a cause  and its time to look for an integrative medical doctor who can work with you locally  and can pull all the information together  check your blood levels of various vitamins and macronutrients  spend time to review your records  and come up with a plan its time to start getting some answers you have a lot going on right now that requires attention
10146,dysautonomia autonomic dysfunction is involved in many neurodegenerative conditions you may need to get several opinions from experienced neurologists that diagnose treat dysautonomia before you find one who can
10147,no occasionally multiple biopsies and the prep may result in a day or two of minor bleeding  and possibly loose stools  but that should resolve rapidly
10148,yes good rheumatologist
10149,allografts many forms of regenerative allografts are currently available in lieu of the common meniscectomy poor long term success the long term outcomes from meniscal allografts are yet inconclusive
10150,maybe there are cartilage surgeries such as microfracture breaking tiny holes in your bone to form scar cartilage  allograft bone cartilage from donor tissue  juvenile particulate cartilage allograft cartilage from young donor tissue  or autologous chondrocyte implantation your own cartilage  grown in lab and reimplanted maybe total knee replacement speak w surgeon to see if u r candidate
10151,pinched nerve possible  needs to be checked out
10152,yes it is safe to get tattooed while breast feeding the only concern is infection so be sure to stick with a reliable  clean tattoo shop the ink is too large to pass in any way to the breastmilk take care and enjoy
10153,internal tremor dopamine agonists like rotigatine  ropinirole  pramipexole may help amantadine can curb dyskinesia from sinemet  but may not help much for inner tremor younger people often tolerate higher doses of artane  trihexyphenidyl than elderly  the drug of choice for pdrelated tremor beta blockers like propranolol may also reduce this tremor ask your neurologist for guidance good luck
10154,wrong diagnosis  if no test can confirm the diagnosis  the diagnosis may be wrong a senior neurologist affiliated with a university may be able to help if they cant find the cause  switch gear and see a good natural doc some of the symptoms may be related to medication  your info suggests you have a heart block yet take a beta blocker  check in with your primary doc regarding medication side effects
10155,you medicines the cause is the medication as i have told you in several notes to you and i have shown you a web site that lists the complications of atenolol  more tests are not the answer  get off the med and find another doctor to take care of you without the bad medicine
10156,many causes  since not feet  neuropathy unlikely carpal tunnel and ulnar neuropathy are the most common  and carpal tunnel invloves all digits except for the last steroid injections can help surgery could be in the cards and repetitive motion activities are causes
10157,many possibilities numbness can occur from various reasons some potential causes include vitamin deficiency  nerve damage  nerve compression  alcohol over consumption  side effects of different medications  or as a result of different systemic medical conditions such as diabetes get evaluated by a professional to determine the diagnosis treatment is based on the diagnosis
10158,impossible to say the ana must be evaluated in the context of the clinical symptoms it is not that specific a test see a rheumatologist for an evaluation
10159,see below lab results need to be interpreted in the clinical context and the doctor who ordered the test is usually in the best position to do that the information you provided suggests scleroderma crest see this site for more info and discuss with your doctor http:  wwwmayocliniccom health scleroderma ds00362
10160,see a specialist would see a rheumatologist who can review your history   examine you  and review your test results and give you an answer
10161,yes ana negative cases of lupus have been reported tissue biopsy is usually needed to confirm diagnosis
10162,yes certainly compatible with lupus but no lab test alone can establish a diagnosis thus you need to consult your rheumatologist
10163,please see rheum please see a rheumatologist as soon as possible for a proper diagnosis people with a strong family history of rheumatologic disease are more likely to develop it speckled pattern ana can be found in systemic lupus and in other connective tissue diseases this needs an evaluation as soon as possible
10164,see doctor may be lupus
10165,difficult to say without specific patient scenario  it is difficult to interpret you can have lab test anomaly without clinical disease open the case
10166,calm down appreciate your concerns  you dont have a definitive diagnosis yet  symptoms and information you gave are sketchy  no one can make even a provisional diagnosis with this material  trust your treating physician  ask for a working   provisional diagnosis  even ask for a second opinion its your right  but stick to professional help rather than dr google  take care
10167,see a rheumatologist your symptoms and lab are consistent with mctd you should see a rheumatologist to get a definite diagnosis and talk about possible treatment this disease requires someone who is familiar with it to determine if you really have the problem or symptoms from another cause
10168,calm down appreciate your concerns  you dont have a definitive diagnosis yet  symptoms and information you gave are sketchy  no one can make even a provisional diagnosis with this material  trust your treating physician  ask for a working   provisional diagnosis  even ask for a second opinion its your right  but stick to professional help rather than dr google  take care
10169,impossible to say there are many disorders that can present with the symptoms you describe does your rheumatologist have any idea what it is if not  get another opinion
10170,results in range didnt get labs reference range with your results  labs do vary with that being said  your % monocytes are a bit high range 28% you are 94 the concern is out of range mean platelet volume mpv range 75115  you test at 122 platelets are cells involved in blood clotting higher ranges indicate platelets are larger  and possibly mean greater risk of stroke or heart attack retest w md
10171,you are okay the lab looks fine to me dont worry about slight elevation of mpv
10172,abnormal laboratory lab shows infection and anemia cause of bleeding
10173,no worry all laboratory results need to be interpreted in the clinical context and the doctor who ordered the tests is usually in the best position to do that having said that  the slightly high rdw is no cause for concern you may wish to take oral iron supplements as women tend to be iron deficient due to menstrual blood loss your test results are okay
10174,no worry all laboratory results need to be interpreted in the clinical context and the doctor who ordered the tests is usually in the best position to do that having said that  the slightly high rdw is no cause for concern you may wish to take oral iron supplements as women tend to be iron deficient due to menstrual blood loss your test results are okay
10175,no  we cant i suspect yore iron deficient microcytic anemia and high platelets and i am not even going to guess on the others this is the wrong forum to bring questions that you have a duty to ask of your personal physician the workup needs to continue best wishes
10176,iron deficiency im a lab specialist labs mean nothing apart from a history and physical exam  and labs arent simply low or high  how low   high is key you owe it to yourself to get with your physician if this is iron deficiency which i suspect  rule out thalassemia  your physician has a duty to find out whether  and why  it means serious treatable illness until proved otherwise stay proactive
10177,no worries minutes variations of rdw and mchc on the second complete blood count are not worth your worry chances are a third one will be back to perfectly normal
10178,continue iron although your total serum iron is improving now at the lower level of the normal range for a woman  you still have some anemic parameters  which the red blood cell distribution width rdw and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration mchc both support there may be reasons for this  such as thalassemia  but since these were normal on 6 18  it is likely still due to low levels of iron
10179,not an issue the rdw  mch and mchc are only helpful in evaluating patients with anemia ron would be unexpected to alter these numbers
10180,ummm let me see if i can translate your post into english: you have bony and disc abnormalities in your lumbar spine and also some hematological abnormalities is that the correct rendering the two have nothing to do with each other did you ask the question of your doctor i recommend that in future you have a native speaker of english check your question before you post it
10181,not much you have a wbc in the range of the upper limit of normal have you had a recent infection none of these values are of concern  and interpretation without the clinical context is problematic
10182,viral these symptoms are consistent with a viral upper respiratory tract infectionhead cold that should run its course in several days to a week at this stage  decongestant pillsif yore not pregnant and nasal spray as well as tylenol are helpful in relieving symptoms see your physician if there is worsening cough  wheezing  new fever  chills and sweats
10183,see your doctor if your symptoms have been going on for this long  its time to see your doctor he she will examine you and probably run some tests to try to get an idea of whats going on
10184,first of all get a throat culture then natural medications for symptom relieftea with honey eucalyptus cough drops etc etc hope this helps dr z
10185,see below it sounds like yore coming down with a respiratory infection we get over 99% of these with fluids  chicken soup and tylenol if symptoms become unbearable  see your doctor
10186,tips for sore throat – gargle with warm salt water 1 2 tsp salt in 8 oz of water *for antiinflammatory effect  mobilizing mucus homemade chicken noodle soup**for hydration lots of water try clear broth* add honey  a small amt of lemon juice to chamomile tea * for congestion – saline nose drops or a neti pot * neti pots can reduce nasal congestion mix ¼ tsp salt w 1 cup distilled lukewarm
10187,sinusitis most likely a flulike viral infection or bacterial sinusitis usually selflimited with hydration  rest and otc symptom relief if symptoms persist or worsen along with fever or evidence of bacterial infection with yellow or green mucous or phlegm  see your doctor for antibiotics
10188,run it by our doctor perhaps  you should put in a formal consult on this site  to see what we can do for you you may have a sinus infection we can call in antibiotics for example
10189,common cold that is what this sounds like
10190,viral infection the symptoms that you are describing can be a viral infection bed rest  lots of fluids if you develop a fever or the symptoms get worse you should contact your doctor viruses are not treated with antibiotics  therefore no need for antibiotics unless you start noticing secretions that are green or yellow  or if you notice spots in your throat that are white or yellowish
10191,flu  cold watch carefully  if the headache and neck pain get worse  please go to your doctor promptly get rest and drink liquids
10192,see physician you should see your physician to get this evaluated
10193,viral probably a bad viral syndrome push fluids tylenol or advil and rest
10194,depends on cause there are many things that can give a child cramps  ranging from constipation  lactose intolerance  and gas to recurrent abdominal pain of childhood please have your child seen by his her doctor to determine the cause once you have a diagnosis  then appropriate treatment can be determined
10195,check out this link follow up with your pcp for any concern take care http:  wwwmwebmdcom heartburngerd tc gasbloatingandburpingtopicoverview
10196,for a few months these symptoms should not last for a few months the type and severity of symptoms of the nature you describe suggest something that needs to be more thoroughly evaluated and workedup by your family doc or a gastroenterologist make an appointment sooner than later
10197,not always although change in bowel habits is a strong indicator of colon cancer  it can signify other things as well  like irritable bowel syndrome  or gallbladder issue  i e stones youre young for colon cancer  and gallbladder issues so it is likely that the source of this lies elsewhere  like your diet you should see your doctor for tests like occult blood test  etc to be sure and for diet help

10256,radiograph there is no blood test that will help diagnose lung cancer a chest xray would be the place to start  but in the absence of symptoms cough up blood  unexplained weight loss for example it is not the best screening test recent studies in the us suggest that a screening ct scan is the way to screen for early cancers however  your best tool is to quit smoking good luck

10261,yes since cancer therapy has become very specialized in recent years  you should look at the individual treatment center or the institute and read posted reviews by treated patients at those centers  rather than focusing on the country germany like many western european countries have very sophisticated cancer treatment centers  with advanced medical machines  they are known to have invented for long
10262,yes you have now possible pregnancy signs and you can repeat pregnancy test after 3 to 5 days if you are pregnant it should be positive or you can have hcg quantative test through your f d or gyn to ascertain then we always advise to have prepregnancy checkup to avoid this problem and you should see your doctor asap either way good luck

10266,yes it may be too early for home pregnancy test to be positive i recommend taking another test in two weeks if still negative  may be premenstrual symptoms
10267,unlikely if you did the test correctly and it was negative 7 days after a missed period  you are not likely to be pregnant you may redo the test in 45 daysuse first morning urine and follow instructions for the test carefully blood test is more sensitive and you may see your doctor for one it is more likely that your symptoms are due to hormonal imbalance
10268,unlikely if you did the test correctly and it was negative 7 days after a missed period  you are not likely to be pregnant you may redo the test in 45 daysuse first morning urine and follow instructions for the test carefully blood test is more sensitive and you may see your doctor for one it is more likely that your symptoms are due to hormonal imbalance
10269,trust the test home pregnancy tests are very accurate they are the same tests used in a doctors office they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period if you doubt the result you can repeat it in 12 days if you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection sounds like just a late period
10270,sure take a pregnancy test
10271,yes the symptoms you describe could be early pregnancy take a pregnancy test: its worth it to find out
10272,see below you may wish to re do pregnancy test use first morning urine and follow the instructions carefully if the result is negative and you miss more than two periods  please consult your doctor
10273,unlikely may not have ovulated if you miss next period consult your gyn 
10274,possible do a home test it shoudl be + if u are preg by now  if  and u dont get your period  see your gyn for an exam and a blood preg test
10275,see below yes you could be pregnant  so do a pregnancy test to be sure one way or the other
10276,maybe anything is possible  but the best way to know for sure is a blood pregnacy test see a dr for your other symptoms too
10277,could be or it could be the start of an infection i would make appointment with gynecologist if you start to see blisters  write back
10278,see below get it looked at possibilities include: abscess  calcified hematoma remnant  or many other lesions lumps
10279,see below dont worry  but dont ignore sounds like it might be a lymph node or possibly a sebaceous cyst small swollen nodes in the groin are common generally these should resolve if this persists or enlarges you should have someone look at it
10280,genital lesion lumps  bumps  blisters and other skin abnormalities on the genitals need to be evaluated an examination will be needed to know the cause and treatment what you describe could be normal  a pimple  herpes  genital warts  syphilis or many other things
10281,folliculitis or abscess  these can be painful and hard try soaking it with cloth soaked in warm water a few times per day and using some astringent
10282,breast bump  pimple it is difficult to say   without having a look at it start by seeing your pmd make an appointment and have it looked at
10283,i think so wellits hard to tell right now spider bites are extremely painful the spider venue thats injected causes necrosis kills cells causing them to look black it can itchbut pain is the number one symptom yes it can be red as well the 2 tiny dots may be the fang injection points
10284,be checked if this new since yesterday be checked for a tick all the best
10285,i do not know it is tough to diagnose rashes skin infections over the computer one condition fitting that description could be a fungal infection of your body  commonly referred to as a ring worm because of the circular eruption it may cause but best to get exam by skin dr to know what it really is best wishes
10286,cyst it would be best to have this examined in person  but we can make a few conjectures it does not sound like a genital wart by your description it could be a small inclusion cyst which is totally not a problem and needs no treatment the other possibility is a condition called molluscum contagiosum however these usually appears as 520 or more bumps  so this is not likely it needs to be seen
10287,a surgeon or a foot doctor podiatrist
10288,non cardiac chestpain could be from other causes also you may have reflux with esophageal irritation ulcer  or spasms ca cause pain have it looked at by a gasteroenterologist
10289,probably not cardiac just curious  were cardiac enzymes  crp part of the blood work this is a good number of tests already given your age  negative tests  i doubt that you have heart disease right now but about 70+% of americans will get it at some point in later life 50s chest pressure can be related to acid reflux   ulcers or muscle strain  which may be the next thing to investigate talk to your doctor
10290,cant say what it is but it appears that it isnt your heart anxiety would be pretty high on my list after this extensive work up you have already had
10291,yes it is unlikely cardiac with the tests being normal anxiety is possible if your symptoms are intermittent gastric reflux can cause chest discomfort  but the numb chin is strange underlying asthma could cause symptoms  but you should have a cough or wheezing hyperventilation could cause both with fast breathing but this would not be constant lastly  inflammation of the breast bone joints woul
10292,no need for now since your pcp and cardiologist   after doing the appropriate evaluation told you that your heart is fine  no need to worry about your heart chest pain can be caused from rib pain  stomach  indigestion or muscular  majority of patients that go er for chest pain is not cardiac
10293,heart is fine i am very surprised that any physician would put you through such extensive and expensive testing it actually blows my mind your heart is fine have you considered working with a personal trainer expert in weight lifting to see how you are lifting and what could be done differently to prevent or avoid too much pain with your workouts and post work out recovery
10294,doubtful the cardiac conditions have been sought  now you need to look into non cardiac conditions like you are 28 unless you smoke  have diabetes  are morbidly obese with a strong family history  why are you stressing about the heart could anxiety issues be a factor
10295,no ddimer is a very nonspecific test and can go up just from a virus make sure you follow up with your doctor
10296,tachy a bit high exercise may help but need a physical  ecg  labs  maybe holter  +   _ chest xray and echocardiogram profile indicates cyclobenzaprine  a centrally acting antispasmodic muscle relaxant with anticholinergic activity this may explain tachycardia diazepam as listed on profile may be linked if withdrawal and or tolerance
10297,depends chest pain has many causes and many implications some are minor and some can be life threatening you could have anxiety  blood clots  muscular  nerve problems  bad acid reflux  a skin problem and much more as it turns out more information a complete history and physical is recommended by the same doctor or emergency room  if you indeed have these symptoms good luck
10298,palpitations depending on the length of the holter monitor it could be normal it all depends on how frequently you get them not because holter is normal means you dont have palpitations you might need a loop recorder or 2 week holter for example
10299,any risk factors usually when i see a 27 y o with chest pain it is not a heart attack its not impossible  just not the top of the list if you have chest pain with difficulty breathing tight that is worse with exertion and better with rest then go to er if you abuse drugs nicotine  have a parent or sibling that has had a heart attack
10300,blistery rashes could certainly be a form of herpes or shingles see dermatologist for correct diagnosis and treatment shingles can occur if you have had chickenpox in the past only
10301, shingles shingles or herpes zoster can present with a red  blister type rash in 1 area on 1 side you need to have a past history of chickenpox or varicella the rash is often preceded by pain if your doctor was able to look at it he could determine this the rash is in a pattern called a dermatone it can be treated with medications for viruses if diagnosed within 12 days of onset also  contact rash
10302,viral illness most likely a viral throat and larynx infection that is causing cough either by vocal cord irritation or progressing to trachea or lungs hydrate  use humidifier  rest voice  use honey and dextromethorphin to suppress cough if it is nonproductive laryngitis is rarely bacterial rash is also probably a viral exanthem
10303,see physician you should see physician to rule out herpes zoster or any other etiology
10304,uri sounds like a common cold or upper respiratory tract infection fortunately  most of these are viral in nature and will resolve with supportive treatment generally  it is advisable to see a doctor for severe discomfort  continued fever and symptoms lasting more than a week
10305,r o uvulitis strep can inflame the uvula and cause uvulitis  you need and exam labs  throat culturesee your doctor for prompt evaluation and tx
10306,could be viral but i always get concerned about strep throat and the rash from strep when i hear about symptoms like yours i strongly recommend you get a throat culture and if positive  treat with oral antibiotic
10307,multiple causes there are several sources of a rash like this that vary greatly in source viral infections leading rashes with these symptoms are common streptococcal infections can lead to similar rashes it will require photography to help clarify
10308,herpangina usually viral tonsillitis herpangina  mono  herpes stomatitis which usually resolves but takes forever bacterial causes are strep throat etc quick visit and testing should pinpoint the culprit  in the meantime lemon  honey gargle works great regards
10309,common cold that is what this sounds like
10310,good news and bad the features you mention along with no big lymph nodes makes strep throat unlikely unfortuantely this does not mean you dont have one of many other infections exam and looking for gunk down the back of the throat or behind the ears is needed
10311,infection although ths is likely viral   strep can present without pusutles on the tonsils probably worth getting swabbed
10312,pharyngitis pharyngitis see md you may need antibiotics
10313,ive had a cough and sore throat first  any high fevers second   cough loose what color phlegm or dry   hacking cough i are you getting any sinus pressure or headaches couple of things before seeing doctor first  warm compresses to the face saline nasal spray increase humidification  hot showers  vaporizer gargle with warm  salty water this might be viral or sinus with some bronchitis if not better  then see dr
10314,amylase and lipase are elevated in pancreatitis if the blood levels of these enzymes are normal  you do not have panreatitis see this site for more info http:  wwwmayoclinicorg diseasesconditions pancreatitis basics definition con20028421
10315,chronic even in acute pancreatitis  these labs are unreliable  there is the possibility of lab error chronic pancreatitis is really more about scarring and injury to nearby structures rather than ongoing tissue damage  and amylase and lipase are usually normal
10316,not necessarily serum amylase and lipase may or may not be elevated in cases of chronic pancreatitis  depending on the severity of inflammation and cell damage of the two  lipase is more likely to mildly elevated while lipase is specific to the pancreas amylase comes from other sources  both are commonly elevated in cases of acute pancreatitis
10317,chronic pancreatitis the amylase and lipase may be elevated in chronic pancreatitis but not always usually you see higher levels of these enzymes when you have acute pancreatitis your doctor can do a ct scan of your abdomen to help decide if you have chronic inflammation suggestive of chronic pancreatitis a plain abdominal xray can also show pancreas calcifications suggestive of chronic inflammation
10318,no the vaccine has no value for treatment it is for protection before exposure getting it afterward is like locking the barn door after the animals run away
10319,hormonal imbalance if the test were negative after a missed period  you are unlikely to be pregnant and the lack of period is due to hormonal imbalance consult the website below for more info http:  wwwnichdnihgov health topics menstruation conditioninfo pages causesaspx
10320,yes if under good control levels may not fluctuate much
10321,anxiety these are common symptoms seen with anxiety you dont have to have anxiety disorder per say  but an event or circumstance that may be causing more stress than usual sometimes the stress is internalized can manifest with shortness of breath  chest pain  and rapid heart rate try some meditation aka mindfulness and see if that helps also  follow your doctors instructions
10322,ultrasound to see a cyst you need to take a look on ultrasound sometime you see it and sometimes you might see a lot of fluid around that shows the cyst already burst open it is possible to bleed but that is not common
10323,worry depression puts everyone on edge something seems to be wrong  but what it is is not clear this leads to worry for kids especially the worry inevitably really leads to the thought that they might be the cause so  reassurance that that is not the case is important also support  if you are not able to be as supportive all the time  make sure that others can fill in
10324,up to four days strenuous exercise frequently triggers a rise in ck that peaks 16 to 24 hours following a workout  then stays elevated for 72 hours before falling back to
10325,yes  its fine  but yes  the tests for chlamydia  gonorrhea  herpes and syphilis is probably accurate as there is 7 days between possible exposure to when the test is done with hiv  however  it may be too soon to detect if this unprotected intercourse exposure could lead to hiv infection it may take up to several weeks usually within 28 weeks but sometimes up to 12 wks before an hiv test may turn positive
10326,std testing the cultures will be accurate  however  if you had a high risk exposure and are worried about stds you should repeat the hiv and syphilis test in three months to allow for the window period this is the time it takes for the test to become positive and early testing can be a false negative
10327,cervicitis other bacteria such as streptococcus  and allergic reactions or chemical irritants are other possibilities
10328,yes  with precaution please use a condom to protect yourself from now on until you are in a monogamous relationship with someone you trust it is not worth the risk
10329,yes yes  it sounds like you had a thorough work up
10330,brown discharge your brown dischargee represent old unoxygenated blood which can be normal
10331,yes  and maybe more see your doctor to have the appropriate tests done  though certain sexually transmitted infectionsstis can present with discharge eg gonorrhea  chlamydia  one can still atypically present with these two stis with unprotected sex  one must also consider other infections such as herpes  hsv2 especially  hiv  and syphilis depending on the discussion you will have with your doctor
10332,rule out  erythroplasia  a premalignant hpv infection if this isnt gone in a few weeks  have a urologist see it
10333,not serious since all the conditions you wrote have been ruled out  and you still have a red dot  it may be completely harmless it can be pearly penile papules do not require any treatment  fordyce spots which are difficult to treat  psoriasis which may start from the glans penis rarely  balanitis posthitis i am sure your doctor has ruled out genital warts by examination if you are concerned consult a dermatologi
10334,condoms and testing if yore going to keep up this level of sexual activity always wear condoms and get tested on a regular basis for sexually transmitted diseases  including hiv  syphilis  gonorrhea  and chlamydia to test for gonorrhea and chlamydia  you need to check all the orifices you use for sex  which can include the mouth throat swab  the anus rectal swab  and the urethra urine test
10335,the the first thing you should do is get a complete std panel based on your history you are at high risk  especially if you have had unprotected sex with some or all of the women your gums could be bleeding from gum disease infection or a number of bleeding disorders abnormalities you need a complete work up by your doctor and a dental visit as well hiv can be transmitted via kissing and the likelihood of transmission rises if blood is present mono is also a possibility  there is no way to give you odds on what you have you need to see a doctor best of luck
10336,no worries your infection was treated with oral medications so tampon use wont affect your treatment remember  your partners need to be treated also  dont get reexposed by an untreated partner   for piece of mind  get a test of cure a month after your rx dont forget to get screened for all of the possible stds gonorrhea  syphilis  hiv  hepatitis  etc take care
10337,get tested please consult your doctor for a blood test for hiv nucleic acid a negative antibody result at this stage will not rule out hiv
10338,probably not hiv initial outbreaks of herpes infection are accompanied by flulike symptoms thats what it sounds like from your history just to be sure get tested for hiv having genital herpes can increase the risk of being infected with hiv
10339,if you engaged in high risk sex  you can test now
10340,constipation with hemorrhoid is the most likely cause unless you have a strong family history of colon cancer at a young age if your symptoms persist see your doctor for evaluation
10341,sounds more like your son is suffering from constipation need to be very aggressive with management need to drink plenty of fluids  six 8 oz or more  need to take laxatives  stool softeners   need good bowel habits have to go at least three times a day and stools should be soft and easy to passblood in the stools are common with chronic constipation  see md asap if w fever  abdominal distention  look sick
10342,constipation common thing are more common than other rare but unwanted possibilities make sure he is hydrated  on good high fiber diet etc see your family doc and referral to gastroenterologist can be made to rule out more uncommon diagnosis but be comforted for now that common things are common and constipation can make one feel backed up  discomfort in abdomen  and at times blood in stool from hemorrhoid
10343,depends on how severe your abdominal pain is and lots of other things  such as fever  tenderness  nausea vomiting it could be any number of 100s of things depending of severity and presence of any other symptoms  you should be seen by a doctor
10344,unusual see doc and have rectal exam and probably colonoscopy something flattened the specimen  and bleeding is not good
10345,not if early a ct is not sensitive enough to find very small colon growths there is a blood test the cea that is high in some cancers  but usually only when quite advanced and not specific to colon cancer now  a ct might suggest a colon cancer  however  colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for detecting colon growths there is research into high definition ct but it is not considered a standard
10346,scanning for cancer good morning: not necessarily blood tests for cancer are not very specific and not too reliable a ct scan can pick up anatomical abnormalities but if the tumor is not large it may not be easily identifiable i would ask for more information on what stimulates your question if you are truly concerned have you asked for an mri or a gastroenterology consultation

10376,too early for flu if this is been going on for more than 24 hours and he is not taking good fluids  he should be seen right away how bad is his headache if he is vomiting because of a headache or has any problems with his vision or a rash or if hes not making sense  please take them to the emergency room right away

10379,a cold sounds like the average common cold its nothing to worry about unless it doesnt clear up after 710 days good luck
10380,sun stroke viral c ur pcp 4 an exam  labs been hot in the east  2 much sun can b a cause in the mean time keep well hydrated  gatorade or similar also 4 electrolytes while u wait 2 b cn

10383,maybe strep  etc nose and throat symptoms can be from cold viruses  strep throat  allergies  etc  it can be difficult to tell what the cause is if symptoms only last 12 days  it was likely allergies  irritation  or a mild cold doctors have rapid 5minute tests for strep  so a primary care doctor can diagnose strep and start antibiotics right away  which means within the first 3 days of strep symptoms
10384,headache and sore throat this could be caused by either a bacterial or viral infection the abdominal pain is often present in those with streptococcal tonsillitis you should see your physician as your physical exam is very important in making the appropriate diagnosis
10385,probably  but these are typical viral illness symptoms  in which case they will resolve within a week or two general measures include drink lots of clear fluids  broth  tea  water  ginger the bad headache is a bit worrisome  but the most common cause of that is dehydration those with chronic hadrink 60 ounces clear fluid daily: watch if ha is severe or worst i ever had: see doc immediately
10386,most likely flu with muscle aches  sore throat  runny nose  headache and fever  sure does sound like the flu good old rest  fluids  and tylenol should help if the fever lasts more than 3 days  belly pain is getting worse  have blood in the stool  or you cant keep any food down  id see your family doctor hope you feel better

10388,treatment options for stage iv breast cancer if the cancer progressed after tamoxifen and aromasin depending on several factors such as how much cancer burder  involvement to visceral organs  overall condition etc the options would be faslodex combination of aromasin and evorilimus  based on recent randomized clinical trial or chemotherapy discuss further with your oncologist which one for your case
10389,chemotherapy if stage iv breast cancer is no longer responsive to tamoxifen or exemestane  it is unlikely that additional hormonal therapy would be of benefit the next form of systemic therapy should probably be chemotherapy if the cancer is her2 neu positive  either chemotherapy with trastuzumab herceptin  or trastuzumab alone could be given
10390,could be  but not necessarily you need to have further tests  such as mammogram  ultrasound  and possibly a biopsy to tell for sure get to a doctor
10391,soy is fine in mod we dont have great data on the effects of soy and phytoestrogens on breast cancer we believe that they act like weak estrogens and may mimic the effects of tamoxifen thus reducing risk but in high doses could have negative effects so it should be safe to eat some soy but avoid large amounts  like in supplements or shakes  etc
10392,avoid it is better to avoid any soy concentrates or its products in u r situation  
10393,cancer make sure you see a gyn oncologyst they are really trained  and will tell you exactly what you need cervica cancer early stages can be treated with surgery more advance stages require only radiation as treatment so make sure you see a specialist dealing only with cancer in the genital area
10394,full partial hysterectomy leaves your cervix if you had cancer in your cervix  you want a full hysterectomy
10395,tamoxifen we dont give tamoxifen in combination with hormone replacement in the us occassionally use vaginal very low dose estrogen cream for vag dryness and tell pts to use a little as they can to relieve symptoms blocking hormones and giving them at same time does not make much sense
10396,dont stop now the purpose of all the treatment is to reduce your risk of recurrence you are fortunate to have a chance at cure if it recurs it is deadly the hardest part is behind you chemotherapy yet the most important treatment   that lowers your risk the most  is whats left talk to your doctors and counselors good luck
10397,half way you are half way done  need radiation after lumpectomy for sure if cancer was estrogen  progesterone receptors er pr positive  you need tamoxifen for added protection to block it from coming back
10398,keep going congrats for finishing chemo please do not stop now if you had a lumpectomy  then you need to get radiation to help decrease your chance of the cancer coming back in the lumpectony area if you skip rad  you recurrence rate is 30% if you do not want to get the rad  then you should get a mastectomy the rad is not as bad as chemo and only takes 78 weeks good luck
10399,keep it up you must feel understandably tired and worn out after chemo but  since you had a lumpectomy and i assume your cancer was er+ it would be unwise not to complete the recommended treatment dont be overwhelmed by this take it one day at a time
10400,see below tamoxifen can be used after other treaments such as surgery  radiation and chemotherapy to prevent a cancer recurrence  or it can be used if cancer has spread in order to slow its growth
10401,chemotherapy tamoxifen is a very effective drug for the treatment of hormonesensitive estrogen receptor + breast cancers it may be used alone or in combination with traditional iv chemotherapy  depending on the cancer stage furthermore  tamoxifen has been shown to be effective reducing the chance of developing breast cancer in highrisk women chemoprevention
10402,breast cancer i presume your sister has seen a reputable breast cancer specialist and undergone all routine workup necessary to arrive at her diagnosis like ultasound mri  biopsy  brca typing  etc reports from a monumental 5year study of women with breast cancer has provided alternate recommendations granted all the above were done  your sister should do well on arimidex
10403,depends by definition breast cancer that has metastasized to the bone is stage iv depending on the patients overall health and response to therapy can live many years
10404,it depends if the bones are the only site of breast cancer metastasis  a person potentially can liver for many years if the cancer involves other organs  the survival is about 1 1 2=2 years
10405,her2pos breast ca herceptin is indicated for her2pos metastatic bc duration of therapy in metastatic setting is not well defined usually it continues as long as it works or discontinued due to toxicity zometa is indicated for bone metastasis in most solid tumors it carries a risk for osteonecrosis of jaw usually it is stopped after 2 yrs if not earlier femara is for postmenopausal bc who has positive er pr
10406,antihistamine although discharge from allergies is usually clear watery  there can be some yellow thicker appearance to it both eyes is more suggestive of allergy than infection consider over the counter antihistamine like zyrtec or claritin for children if it worsens  or the lids are matted together then an antibiotic drop may be needed if the allergies cont to bother  antihistamine drops can be rxd
10407,allergies based on your description  it is likelydue to allergies trycool compresses  chilled artificial tears  and topical and or oral allergy meds
10408,i think yes only if by 2 you mean 2 yrs and not 2 days or 2 weeks   or even 2 months for a 2 yo with a fever tylenol is acceptable and you should dose it at 10 to 15 mg per kilo of weight  give it 4 6 hrs apart i do no recommend the tylenol motrin game that ers have been doing lately fever tends to last about 4 days if your child is very sick with or w o fever you should see ur doctor good luck
10409,yes yes   and you can give them both together
10410,allergies have you tried over the counter allergy remedies such as an antihistamine tablets and eye drops if your symptoms persist  you might consider consulting with an allergist n
10411,see your doctor if your allergies are not controlled with one med alone  stepping up to a different med like flonase  nasonex  etc   will likely help you more than taking two antihistamines zyrtec and claritin will not help much at all if you have a cold and not allergies  though benadryl can dry up secretions somewhat you can add mucinex if you also have a cough talk with your doctor about your symptoms
10412,see an allergist see an allergist who can help you identify what you are allergic to  if it is allergies  and help prescribe a combination of medications that will control your symptoms
10413,red eyes if the redness is due to allergies then it should help
10414,same each of the medicines work for some people others for other people no one medicine works for everyone all of the time sometimes you have to try different ones to see which one works best for you
10415,all good zyrtec  allegra and claritin are all antihistamines that all work well for allergy symptoms before one takes any medications  they should check with their physician to make sure the are the appropriate choice
10416,allergy season its allergy season you seem to be suffering from it allergy eye drops should not affect pregnancy cromolyn nasal spray wont either neither will warm salt water gargles if you want an oral med  generic benadryl or claritin are considered safe in pregnancy  although pills are always best avoided if possible all of these are available without prescription
10417,claritin it is not necessary to use both medications  the claritin should help for the hivesgive him a dose in the morning as well as a dose at night if necessary
10418,yes those two medications work very differently on allergies  and it is ok short term for a few days to combine the two if you need to also make sure he gets plenty to drink as both of these tend to dry up mucous membranes and he may feel very thirsty
10419,remove the allergen she may have perennial allergies to pets or dust mites it would be best not to use systemic medication in such a young infant try to find out what her allergies are have the older ones been tested and remove the allergen from the environment
10420,get checked see your pediatrician  he may have a cold instead  allergies at this young age unlikely  
10421,yes  but theres no harm in using a nasal saline spray if it helps your runny nose  its fine
10422,possibly nasal saline is a mild decongestant so it may be beneficial to use in patients with ear congestion from allergies
10423,not a good idea you will dilute the flonase nasal spray and it is not a good idea flonase is a nasal steroid which has anti inflammatory properties and delivers a certain amount of steroid dose and it does take some time to work and saline will dilute that dose
10424,no sorry that you are going through this i have also i found that if you tough it out and breath through your moouth in a short time it will all open up in the meantime dont use anythin
10425,yes nasal steroid takes several days to get optimal results  afrin should not be used for more than 5 days else you may end up with even more nasal congestion rebound methylprednisolone is not usually indicated for bronchitis if chronic this may be asthma consider seeing an allergist
10426,try ginger tea it sounds like u have a viral illness with those nasal symptoms + cough my personal favorite what i use is ginger tea try boiling a chunk of fresh ginger for 10 min  let cool a little bit  add honey the over the counter throat medicines  lozenges may help  ever tried the hurricane spray i would try the ginger tea first sometimes u can get it in the tea aisle if u dont want to make it
10427,uri vs allergies if this has been going on for a few days it is most likely a viral upper respiratory tract infection usually rest  fluids and otc analgesics and med for congestion may help you may also use honey for cough and congestion if you are having itching associated with symptoms and ongoing might be allergies so medication like otc loratadine can help
10428,congestion saline nasal spray can help with nasal congestion and reduce sinus pain and congestion
10429,many things you can utilize warm salt water gargles to help with your throat pain and salt water saline rinses for the nose make sure you are resting well  eating well and staying hydrated be aware that your symptoms may be related to allergies and you may consider a trial of over the counter antiallergy therapies  like antihistamines  but only if you tolerate these medicines
10430,time heals all thing your elbow to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze  or cough into your shirt  and be sure to wash your hands to prevent spread we all get a shot at having a cold  but none of us want one many things are sold in the cold aisle  but the data is not strong you can suppress your cough for the movie or theater  with cough drops  ricola  halls  etc antihistamines can dry a runny nose
10431,hay fever likely from allergic rhinitis and you should check with your doctor to try you on a prescription nasal spray
10432,diagnosis impossible to be made simply on your written description  but it sounds like you could have a viral cold that will have a selflimited course yet is your symptoms progress  you should see your local doctor for further treatment
10433,illness by just the symptoms alone it cannot be clearly diagnosed there are many illnesses with those symptoms it is probably best to see your doctor the exam will help tell what you have
10434,probably virus your description is that of a typical viral pharyngitis if the sore throat persists longer than two more weeks  then take him back to the doctor seems as though the doctor did all that is indicated in this case from your brief description
10435,sinusitis or reflux if hes not getting better  as mentioned  he could have drainage from a sinus infection causing the sore throat  or he could have acid reflux those are the types of things a doctor could check him for a viral infection should go through its various coldlike stages and get better in 710 days allergies without a secondary infection rarely cause a sore throat
10436,viral illness an adenovirus will give your symptoms
10437,pharyngitis viral or bacterial pharyngitis would want to make sure you dont have strep throat so yo should get an exam  a strep test and or culture
10438,uri uri can take up to 1014 for improvement symptomatic treatment for now see md if no better in 7 days
10439,have you been checked for mononucleosis or strep throat any yellowing of eyes stop smoking right away it you have up to two packs a day that will make things much worse it is time to see your physician now if you havent already done so
10440,see below who told you the possibilities strep and mono can both be tested for certainly there are numerous viruses that can cause your symptoms  that are normally not tested for
10441,herpangina your symptoms are consistent with a coxsackie infection called herpangina self limited treat symptomatically
10442,are they ulcers herpes gingivostomatits can do this
10443,treat congestion if you have a sinus infection ou need medication to help with drainage of our sinuses  not just the antibiotic
10444,prolonged sore throa you may have a retro pharyngeal abscess see a doctor he may want to take an xray of your upper airway alternately you have a viral illness that can give you similarsymptoms
10445,could be a unilateral one sided infection is always problematic many otolaryngologists ent doctors worry that a unilateral swelling of a tonsil may be serious it would be wise for you to get an opinion by a specialist in ear  nose and throat diseases for a diagnosis
10446,baking soda paste make a paste of 2 parts baking soda and one part water apply in a cloth to effected area of skin
10447,not to much try vinegar
10448,take benadryl benadryl will block certain chemicals ie histamine from being released as to result in swelling and itching bee stings can produce a wide range of reactions in severe allergic reactions to bee stings as in anaphylaxis difficulty breathing  swelling of throat etc one may need an epipen  prescribed by a doctor
10449,simply monitoring lymphatic system absorbs carries things too big to go into the arteries veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria viruses cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
10450,bee sting immediately ice packs will help decrease the swelling also antihistamines and or advil will help
10451,bee stings clean area w soap  warm water apply ice in 10 min increments 10 on 10 off can try tylenol  aspirin or motrin for pain or benadryl for swelling make paste of 2 parts baking soda  1 part water  apply need tetanus shot every 10 years throat  airway  mouth swelling or difficulty breathing call 911
10452,quick fix when our bodies sustain an injury  the immediate response is inflammation red  hot  tender swelling this is the body increasing the blood flow to the injury to bring healing factors to the area and also the veins expand to carry bad stuff away the key is to do things that reduce the parts of inflammation such as ice  compression  elevation and antiinflammatory medications in the first 24hrs
10453,bee or wasp sting throat  airway  mouth swelling or difficulty breathing epi pen er  call 911 seek medical care for milder allergic reactions: swelling of > 4 inches  nausea  gi cramps  diarrhea
10454,use epipen  go to er you may have no problem with this  but if you have an allergy or you think you do  my advice is to get to an er asap they will give you epinephrine so you dont go into anaphylactic shock  which can close your airway and kill you after this episode is over  you might want to see your doctor and get an epipen  which is a shot of epinephrine you can give yourself quick if this happens again
10455,bee sting you can also use an ice pack to help with swelling put a cloth towel between the ice and the skin and do not let the ice stay on the skin for longer than 20 minutes letting ice sit directly on the skin or keeping ice on too long can result in frostbite from the ice pack make sure you remove the stinger
10456,bee sting remove stinger by scraping along edge of skin with credit card clean area with soap  warm water apply ice in 10 min increments alternating 10 on  10 off you can take tylenol  aspirin or motrin for pain or benadryl for swelling make a paste of 2 parts baking soda  1 part water  apply or you can apply a meat tenderizer poultice to the area throat  airway  mouth swelling call 911
10457,er or primary md initially cold will help and antiinflammatories such as anvil or motrin if not contraindicated reaction can be treated with oral steroids if necessary
10458,sting in uncomplicated situations  there is usually fairly good resolution within 72 hours
10459,ice heat in the first few hours after the extraction  it is recommended that you out ice on the cheek on the side of the extraction after the first day  you can put mild heat always be careful not to hurt yourself with the ice or heat if the swelling is painful  and doesnt seem to improve  then consult with your dentist or surgeon immediately
10460,postop swelling some swelling is normal and to be expected after wisdom tooth extractions i recommend applying ice for the first three days  followed by moist heat if necessary at that point sometimes a short course of steroids is prescribed to minimize swelling if yore concerned about the amount of swelling or if it persists  contact or go see your oral surgeon to determine if healing is normal or not
10461,rue could be right cervical ridiculous thy pinched nerve  brachial plexopathy or even a mono neuropathy like carpal tunnel causing proximal symptoms 
10462,pinched nerve the nerves to the arm come out from the spinal cord from the neck vertebrae  a pinched nerve  at this level  could cause these symptomssee your doctor if this persists  epically if there is numbness and or weakness
10463,consider gallstones especially if pain radiates to middle of back get an ultrasound of your gallbladder
10464,nerve issue pain and numbness in a limb sounds like a pinched nerve it can be pinched in the neck or wrist as well as possibly other places in the arm carpal tunnel can cause these symptoms as well and often cause numbess in thumb and index finger you can try over the counter nsaids and a wrist splint but if sx arent going away and especially if you have weakness you should see your doc
10465,yes numbness and weakness in the right upper and lower extremities may indicate nerve compression at the level of the spine mri and emg could localize and prognosticate a compressive neuropathy and would give guidance to appropriate treatment options consult with a physical medicine and rehabilition specialist would be appropriate
10466,2 nerves one pinched nerve cant cause numbness in arm and leg so look for other causes  or multiple levels of disease
10467,maybe depends what was the cause of these problem i see very commonly patient that sustained an mva or motorcycle accident with pain in those areas that you referred could be a contusion or sprain of pectoralis muscles costochondritis could also be considered if pain in sternum rib junction reproduced with palpation
10468,physical therapist spend an hour with a physical therapist that can educate you in the proper home exercises for carpel tunnel  aka cts
10469,radiculopathy pain that radiates down the arm can reflect a cervical radiculopathy shooting pains due to a pinched nerve in the cervical spine symptoms going to the small finger would suggest involvement of the c8 nerve these conditions typically resolve with time and conservative treatment it would be reasonable to watch it for a week or two  and use nsaids if needed  before seeing a physician
10470,ulnar neuritis sounds like you have irritation of the ulnar nerve it is very sensitive by the inner posterior aspect of your elbow …:your funny bone… if you bumped this area or slept on it wrong it could have caused an irritation usually gets better with time  rest  avoiding impact get it checked if it does not improve
10471,sleeping on your arm puts a great deal of pressure on your rotator cuff and drives the cuff up into your shoulder blade and collarbone it is akin to someone clamping you thigh for eight hours it is going to hurt furthermore your ac joint also can become inflamed finally the nerves in you arm get stretched and irritated try sleeping in a recliner  wear a shoulder immobilizer  or sleep with your back supported
10472,not strike pain is not symptom of acute stroke pinched nerve in neck is much more likely
10473,these these are signs of a stroke right sided numbness  tingling  facial numbness and you need to call 911 right now strokes can be caused either by a bleed or a clot in the brain  decreasing circulation to parts of the brain the longer the clot or bleed is left untreated  the greater the chance of stroke extension  paralysis  loss of body function  and death time is brain call 911 asap do not drive

10478,big stone 10mm it seems to be a big stone  10mm stones do not pass on their own 4mm stone has 80% chance of passing and 5mm 20% 10 mm stone can not pass by itself and has to be removed surgically follow your doctors advice
10479,highly unlikely   it may pass  but its highly unlikely given its size and shape eswl or extracorporial shock wave lithotripsy may be done to smash the stone but it can result in bleeding and internal trauma so surgery might be the best option here best of luck
10480,ranitidine or zantac is an h2 blocker drug meant to reduced your stomach acidity it is safe for you to take however i would recommend rid yourself and have the gall bladder removed you will feel better  acidity may be a thing of the past and you will prevent possible serious complication gall stones can induce

10483,that is correct you may get by without stent for treating a 1cm kidney stone with eswl  but always prepare and commit yourself for possible intervention to stent ureter or remove fragments piling up in distal ureter with possible pending infection above the stonerelate blockage so  doc is fair and right for you
10484,probably not prophylactic placement of a ureteral stent prior to eswl is somewhat controversial depending on the situation stents themselves may cause significant pain and other problems if there is no obstruction  infection or other complicating factor  then placement of a stent before eswl is usually not necessary for stones less than 2 cm also  a stent can always be placed after the eswl if needed

10537,carefully and with knowledge snoring may be an initial sign of a greater  lifethreatening problem she needs to see her physician and will most likely need a take home sleep test or one done at a facility there are benefits to each type  talk to your md if its just snoring or mild sleep apnea  a special mouth guard may help  made by a dentist
10538,any level from low to normal to high can occur with either heart attack or stroke with very high 150and greater systolic and 100 or so diastolic a number of bad things can happen: aortic teardissection  and heart attack or stoke may evolve with high pressure intracranial aneurysm may burst  o r the brain may bleed complex sets of diagnostic issues
10539,always a risk if bp is skyhigh  such as malignant hypertension  risk of brain hemorrhage is high  but even modest chronic elevation can increase risk for stroke and or heart problems in other words  follow american heart association recommendations and keep bp under tight control
10540,yes it the blood pressure is too low or the pulse is too low  the answer is yes you need an adequate opening or closing pressure for the arteries to have blood running
10541,get bp checked now if you have a way to check your bp at home  do it now if not  see your doctor  an urgent care  or go to the emergency room now your bp may be seriously high  and putting you at a high risk of a stroke or heart attack
10542,opposites hemophilia is a defect of blood coagulation such that the blood does not clot heart attacks and strokes are a result of clots forming in the arteries feeding the heart and brain respectively these latter clots can be formed locally due to damage to the blood vessels or an increased clotting tendency  or from clots that embolize from somewhere else in the body
10543,hemophiliacs may be at increased risk for strokes and heart attacks when receiving blood factors for episodes of bleeding this is rare hemophilia does not protect against developing coronary artery disease
10544,should not as asked  ibuprofen would not cause you to have a heart attack prolonged use of nsaids may lead to kidney damage and or intestinal inflammation good luck
10545,tingling this is more than likely due to something in your neck irritating a sensory part of the nerve usually c6 or c7 if you are concerned about it you should see your family doctor signs of a stroke are usually more pronounced ie  facial weakness  arm weakness  speech disturbance  visual changes
10546,possibly this may be related to a nerve compression syndrome  but tia or atypical angina need to be considered see your doc to get it checked out
10547,no stating drugs have been shown to decrease plaque most otc supplements have not been proven if you have plaque cussing symptoms you should talk to your doctor about treatments dont take a chance dissolving plaque should not increase the risk of a stroke or vascular event make sure you dont risk your life health on unproven claims
10548,no this is kind of a semantic answer dissolving plaque is rare to begin with and a realistic goal is stability it is best to think of this plaque dissolving more like being smooth out over time but if there are pits nooks crannies call it what you like there can still be tumbling blood that can clot and cause stroke any symptom should be discussed with your neurologist
10549,heart attack heart attack is from complete occlusion of one of the arteries unless opened right away  can lead to permanent damage resulting in a scar of the myocardium normal mibi  low chol and bp means you are a low risk for developing coronay plaque which usually is the reason for heart attack plaques can break leading to occlusion in the arteries that result in heart attack
10550,get treated you are describing rather severe hypertension which is uncontrolled you are at increased risk for heart disease  stroke  kidney failure  and accelerated atherosclerosis you really should seek medical evaluation immediately at an er or urgent care facility you should be on aggressive treatment for your high blood pressure
10551,seek seek care immediately in an emergency room
10552,poss vaginal trauma you didnt say if intercourse was painful need a vaginal pelvic exam  pap smear see your gyn
10553,implantation bleed implantation bleeding usually occurs 68 days after ovulation i suggest waiting till your expected period and then doing a home preg test
10554,postcoital bleeding it could be due to a cervical polyp  or an infection you should go have it checked out by a gynecologist
10555,possible likely you would itch other time too  urinating etc other possibilitis include reaction to condoms if used or any other lubricants
10556,work on it slowly a bad break up can result in a temporary loss of trust in the safety and the genuineness of intimate relationships its very difficult to enjoy sex when lacking such sense as you build a new relationship  and you gain a sense of safety and trust in this relationship  intimacy and sex will be pleasurable again work on it slowly  and listen to your heart
10557,missed period please take a home pregnancy test and if it is negative  i would see my ob or primary doctor to have them check a serum bhcg to make sure you are not pregnant
10558,low likelihood morning after pills are quite effective if used as instructed the brown discharge are likely due to hormonal effects of the morning after pill and sloughing of the uterine lining if concern about pregnancy  consider rechecking again and take another pregnancy test though your likelihood of pregnancy is low based on what you have provided
10559,pregnant no you re not pregnant brown discharge may be old unoxygenated bloood
10560,yes you may be using the wrong antibiotics you may want to talk with your doctor
10561,probably not this scenario seems unlikely a different diagnosis may be the cause
10562,possible pregnancy you need to take a pregnancy test to know for sure it doesnt sound likely  however  many people continue to bleed during their pregnancy
10563,nonspecific symptom its possible that you are pregnant if you had intercourse without using any contraception however  the white discharge is a nonspecific symptom and doesnt mean you are or are not pregnant best wishes
10564,many possible causes some causes of leg swelling can include cellulitis  lymphatic obstruction  blood clots  varicose veins and trauma have it evaluated by a professional and get the appropriate treatment
10565,could be reflux you may have problems with venous insufficiency these is what leads to varicose veins and many times presents as swelling without seeing veins on the surface ask you r doctor to order a venous reflux study from the vascular lab
10566,are you sure no dvt it would be important to clarify that there is no dvt sometimes you can have a negative ultrasound on the first check and a second 1 is needed other things that can cause leg swelling maybe heart failure but you are a little young for that also infections in the leg such as cellulitis can cause this in rare cases there can be something compressing vessels in pelvis causing this go see doctor
10567,venous insufficiency varicose veins
10568,most likely not dvt pain mostly in the calf because that where the deep vein is  if you are having a pain around your varicoses vein it could be your superfical veins not your deep one to be sure get venous doppler to ruled out the dvt
10569,doppler and legs very accurate there are a million other reasons for pain why do you think you have a dvt
10570,unusual 30 s female w pain in sciatic region of thigh asks whether is blood clot this is unusual region for blood clot if is blood clot would expect swelling of leg  pain elicited by direct pressure on region  when tense leg flexor muscles against resistance that said  these sympmptoms in someone who already had leg blood clot causes all bets off  and doctor and ultrasound are probably indicated
10571,possibly you mentioned another blood clot  i am assuming yove had one before if so  it is possible that yove had another one secondly  could be stretched hamstring or muscle strain lastly  if all is negative then consider a spine issue as a possibility that may need further evaluation
10572,ans well need more information any swelling or pain or redness can you walk without pain you are best to see your doctor
10573,reflux reflux or backflow of the veins in the superficial or deep system can cause this as well as lymphedema
10574,possible possible to get swelling around this time due to venous congestion  cardiovascular changes  or vein compression usually later if swelling gets worse do keep an eye on it and get tested to exclude dvt
10575,absolutely  although it is less likely at your age without knowing your history  in addition to immobility  i would mention birth control pills  smoking or an inherited hypercoagulable state would also increase your risk any recent surgical intervention would also raise the risk twitching is not a specific symptom  but the sensation of a heavy leg and the location raise concern ultrasound would be the first test
10576,dvt the list of things which can cause redness and swelling in one leg is quite long and difficult to pinpoint without further information the most worrisome cause would be a thrombosis blood clot involving a deep vein of the lower extremity also referred to as dvt urgent consultation with a physician is recommended as the complication of dvt can be dire infection is less likely at one month
10577,see your doctor soon you may have a dvt bilaterally  or the beginning of an infection or gout  etc
10578,yes yes you body will reabsorb a vanishing twin and it will not affect your pregnancy whatsoever this is very common
10579,depends on what happens in the surgery as to when sex check with ur gyn have the gyn take a look t ur tubes shouldnt need ivf
10580,see a obgyn you need to see a obgyn for your initial pregnancy evaluation to see if the cramps are normal or not
10581,growing pains if the pressure is not severe  it is likely due to the increasing weight of your uterus as it grows this is normal and no cause for alarm call your ob for eval if tylenol and warm baths dont bring relief
10582,unlikely when ivf is performed appropriately  your chance of ectopic is very low certainly it should be less than 2% however  there could be abnormalities of the uterus or tubes that predispose so a complete evaluation before ivf is appropriate but in general you should not have another ectopic with ivf
10583,no if you do not have ovaries you will not ba able to conceive if your uterus is functional  you may be able to achieve a pregnancy with donor eggs and ivf
10584,very unlikely depoprovera is a very reliable method depoprovera failures are very rare you could always take a home pregnancy test to reassure your self
10585,possible clot late pregnancy at risk for deep vein clot which can be fatal symptoms almost always accompanied by swelling on just the one side  left leg is more common if no swelling then nerve compression more likely less dangerous get to your doc or er now
10586,check asap losing arterial blood flow is an emergency symptoms include loss coldness  numbness  pale limb  no swelling decrease motor activity   painfull and of course no pulse by exam  you need to be checked asap if you have the above
10587,probably not most women with fibroids have no trouble becoming pregnant  but it depends on the fibroid location more problems can be encountered with fibroids after pregnancy begins than prior
10588,location location locationdepends on where they are fibroids that distort the uterine cavity can make pregnancy challenging either by preventing implantation or preventing growth in utero an good high quality pelvic ultrasound can answer this question combined with a saline infusion sonohysterogram in order to really determine the architecture of the cavity
10589,its possible small amount of sworn could come out during sex its definitely possible
10590,possibly but more likely another factorperhaps related to the numerous salivary glands present under the tongue have your dentist evaluate you and establish a diagnosis
10591,no herpetic lesions are not likely to be limited to just under the tongue ulcers are generally self limiting and will resolve within 2 weeks if they persist  or become too painful to function normally you can see a dentist to help evaluate and treat they can have various causes of course the best way to know for sure is to simply go see a dentist for an exam best of luck  hope its not too bad
10592,herpes herpes are not pimples they are a cluster of blisters and are very painful
10593,maybe unlikely if they dont hurt or burn but probably worth getting checked out by a doctor there are often community health clinics or even planned parenthood which will let you go without your folks otherwise an issue for 16 year olds and get seen free
10594,no you cannot get gonorrhea from hsv infection however gonorrhea could be contacted earlier without symptoms and the presence of hsv may unmask the spread of gonorrhea resulting in symptoms geting tested and receiving treatment and use protective will be neccessary to prevent further std and possible need for long term hsv management to reduce outbreaks
10595,remember gonorrhea is an infection that you have to contract from someone the only way for you to become infected with gonorrhea is to be sexually active with someone already infected
10596,see a doctor answers on healthtap arent intended for individual treatment  prescription or diagnosis  and even if they were this would have to be seen and examined
10597,yes certainly this can occur and sometimes taking an antibiotic care suit is vaginal yeast infection get checked by your medical provider if you have symptoms
10598,probably acne cyst arleen  this is probably an acne cyst  which is a ruptured  painful bump where an oil gland ruptured below the skin the body walls this off and makes a filled cavity called a cyst often this is serious and can scar  so you should see a dermatologist for help possibly  an injection of the cyst with a dilute cortisone would help
10599,keratosis pilaris white bumps on the cheeks sounds like keratosis pilaris  http:  wwwmedicinenetcom script main mobileartasparticlekey=91543page=0 heres an article describing what that is and you can see if the description works for your rash see a doctor to be sure other causes are possible  this usually is not serious   but on the face   it can be more bother than on the arms or legs 
10600,coated tongue your tongue may be coated due to an infection which can sometimes be caused by a yeast or virus it is very important that you see your doctor to determine the actual cause of your infection so that the appropriate treatment can be initiated
10601,sciatica your pain may be due to sciatica please look it up online to familiarize yourself with this condition and what you can do to treat this condition at home if the pain worsens or continues it may be time to see your doctor good luck
10602,sore throat you should see a doctor for an evaluation you have an infection and need treatment see a doctor
10603,yes i do  but they are just ideas see your physician who can tell you for sure and how to make you feel better
10604,sinus all the mucous built up from the flu mightve turned into a sinus infection get checked out to confirm
10605,cannot diagnose you need to see a doctor  be examined and diagnosed and treated by somebody face to face cannot do this over the internet
10606,sinus headache as long as bp is ok  the best treatment for sinus congestion is an antihistamine decognestant with fluids to avoid drying effect and perhaps  a nasal steroid to decrease the inflammation
10607,pulsations in ear if the pulsating sensation in the ear is recent and related to the sinus pressure in your head and cold symptoms  it is to be expected a cold commonly is associated with dysfunction of the eustachian tube connecting the nose and ear a visit to your ear nose and throat doctor will likely be helpful because prescription medications to reduce inflammation will also affect the ear pulsations
10608,can b normal an audible pulse or whooshing sound is not uncommon it is often a normal finding and can be due to mild compression of the temporal artery  which is located in front of the ear this often occurs at night with a pillow though it can be a subtle sign of high blood pressure it is usually a benign finding if it becomes too bothersome  you may want to consult your doctor
10609,evaluation you need to be evaluated by your doctor and have ct of head to find the cause so you be treated
10610,get checked see a neurologist and have your cranial joints tm joints  occiput and frontal sinus for the presence of toxins  pathogens  allergens as the cause of the tension has make sure you rule out the presence of mold toxins as a factor for the sinus pressure
10611,see a doctor inflammation of the throat can produce referred pain to the ear if the ear is involved directly it can produce headache you may need a decongestant  but the best thing to do is to let a doctor take a look at this and make certain there is nothing requiring more aggressive therapy hope this clears up soon
10612,a a diagnosis is very difficult to make without a proper history and physical based on your post it sounds like you may be dealing with a sinus  ear  or throat infection however the stiff neck is a little worrisome because it could be a sign of meningitis inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain and spinal cord  typically meningitis is accompanied by fever regardless you need to be evaluated by a medical professional right away for work up  diagnosis  and treatment good luck
10613,upper respiratory sounds like you have the after effects of a cold the pressure in your sinuses is due to excess mucous causing pressure the fullness in your is due to backed up fluid from your sinuses and nose you have a swollen lymph gland in your neck which is causing pain and giving you a stiff neck the phlegm from your sinuses and nose can make you nauseous and chills you are tired because of the cold
10614,whoa until proven otherwise  this is an infection like most infections your body is able to manage them with time your body will make antibodies to the infection  cause an inflammatory reaction to help cure the infection and with time get better this is normal if you feel like the normal course of events are not happening  talk to your doctor
10615,see below i think you need a medical exam to determine cause of lump
10616,low if you ever had sunburn before in your life  its likely that you received more hard radiation from that experience risk of radiation induced cancer is not only dose dependent but also related to recovery time between exposure
10617,mri more sensitive can find lesions earlier
10618,depends it depends on the type of tumor and its location it also depends on size of the tumor if the tumor enhances when you add contrast  its easier to see after it grows to just a few millimeters some tumors which grow slowly are undetected because no one does a scan but the scan would have shown it if one was done
10619,stop there is some small risk of repeated ct scans so please stop and have the ordering physician look at your previous test before ordering a new study mri does not expose you to radiation and is better to evaluate for tumor or other structural brain lesion
10620,read below three ct scans in 3 months sounds like an anxiety state most headaches are benign but you can have an mri to settle the question
10621,cannot predicy if after all those ct scans there has benn no change in the finding  then the likelihood it is nothing to worry about your risk of cancer is not increased by this nodule or the ct there are never any guarantees that you wont get cancer a healthy life style without smoking and the like will certainly be in your favor good luck
10622,likely not tumor it depends on the frequency and severity of symptoms  but you might consider requesting your doctor to order an mri brain with and without contrast it provides better detail of the brain than does the ct
10623,no you need to do more scans this time to rule out any new issues most time it is not serious  but it is hard to predict without ct or mri
10624,no first off  the amount of radiation from a head ct is very small less than the smiunt you get from the sun and cosmic rays in 1 year secondly  even if it were to cause that  it would take many many years
10625,no this is highly unlikely
10626,please see your doctor you need to be examined and might need an anti biotic eye drops  as for the eye allergies  after your infection resolves you need to be put on maintenance therapy for sometime  your eye doctor allergist would help you better good luck
10627,male or female this is a description of venous malformation of the left renal vein entrapped by the aorta it is not associated with neoplasm see 
10628,very little chance because our understanding of radiation induced cancer is incomplete  it is assumed that any exposure to radiation increases the risk of developing cancer this is called the nonthreshold model according to a recent nejm article the risk is approximately 0005% at age 35 that a single ct brain would cause death due to cancer n engl j med 2007 357:22772284 the risk is even smaller at > age
10629,likely not tumor it depends on the frequency and severity of symptoms  but you might consider requesting your doctor to order an mri brain with and without contrast it provides better detail of the brain than does the ct
10630,likely flu but if you are concerned  it is better to bring him to see a doctor
10631,i would if this process has gone on for a week i would have her seen by her pcp in the next 24 hrs
10632,not worried just cautious if the headache continuously worsens or your visious starts to blurr or you start vomiting or your mentation changes or you balance then you should go to the er meanwhile put ice on the hit to the head aoou can take whatever you have at home for the headache and that would be fine too
10633,depends as long as your baby remains active  feeds or drinks fairly well without running fever  watching for 23 days would be reasonable
10634,cold sounds like a viral infection  use a saline nasal spray to aid his congestion and over the counter tylenol if he has a low grade fever if the symptoms continue beyong 3 days  take him to the doctor
10635,yes you must rule out the possibility of bleeding into the brain there is a well known lucid interval that may last for hours following a head injury it would be wise to go to the emergency room and rule out the possibility of a sub dural bleed
10636,get checked it is best to get checked as soon as possible dont think that you can sleep off a concussion its better to be safe
10637,not sure what you mean by meds but if your doctor prescribed a prescription nasal spray some folks can develop frontal headaches after using them if that is the issue then it is not normal and your should discontinue the spray and call your doctor
10638,not necessarily it appears that you are developing laryngitis voice box inflammation in most cases it is caused by a virus and is a self limited disease requiring no major treatment or a visit to doctor fever  especially past 3 days  symptoms of choking  drooling  stridor whistling while taking a breath  shortness of breath must be evaluated promptly as they may be a sign of a life threatening disease
10639,listen to your body when you lose your voice  your first instinct should be to rest it that means no whispering  shouting or talking on the cellphone in public as these stress the voice if this is sudden  rest and treat the likely oncoming cold flu with supportive measures if the change lasts more than 10 days or you get better but the voice is still gone  go see a voice specialist were here to help you

10641,close observation ok to wait if he is happy   active and eating well  check out with your pediatrician if he is fussy  vomiting  not eating well  fever more than 3 days also deserve a trip to the doctor  green snot does not mean much

10644,gastritis im not sure what your symptoms were that led to an endoscopy on an 18 yr old  but dizzy and sluggish are not suggestive of mild gastritis and acid reflux not knowing anything about you such as your bmi or medical history and medications  its not possible to provide a relevant differential diagnosis for your symptoms please consult your doctor
10645,gastric irritation among other things an ulcer of the stomach is possible given your symptoms an examination by your doctor is well advised since catching this type of problem early is key to making sure it doesnt follow you around for the rest of your life
10646,no  its probably the side effects of the hydrocodone all opioids have the potential to cause release of histamine from mast cells the cells involved in allergy by a direct effect while it is not truly allergy   it acts like it  and nausea  diarrhea  itching  skin flushing and even hives can result some opioids cause this effect more than others there may be medications that will do less of this for you
10647,opioid allergy is common  most often symptoms are nausea  vomiting  itching  hypotension and constipation opioids may have side effects that mimic immune reactions  not a real a real allergic reaction rec: see your treating physician for evaluation and medication adjustment
10648,site of reflux it depends where the side of the reflux irritates if it irritates the throat near the sea eustachian tube then you could get pain and some of these other areas it is not uncommon for throat pain to also causing ear pain if the reflux irritate you station to you could have middle ear involvement that could cause your dizziness
10649,not normal it is likely that this was from a drug reaction and not normal if the problem continues to improve  id expect that you will fully recover in another week if not  see your doctor since it may also be from something else
10650,see below hi  if you missed your period then start with a home pregnancy test and if thats negative then see your doctor for your lower abdominal symptoms as you may have a urinary tract infection hope this helps
10651,vague symptoms menstrual irregularities like a missed period can occur with an infection or a noninfectious inflammatory process or even psychological trauma anything that alters hormonal balances can do this you might want to use another home pregnancy test on a first am voided urine specimen in a week and make sure  otherwise wait and see what happens next month
10652,home pregnancy tests are very accurate they are the same tests used in a doctors office they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period  if you doubt the result you can repeat it in 12 days if you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection
10653,prolonged fatigue given how long the symptoms have persisted  i would strongly recommend that you seek medical attention soon for a physical exam as well as laboratory workup i also dont know why you are on antibiotics and if the infection is persistent
10654,family practice if your symptoms last longer then 48 hrs you should be seen
10655,no eeg is a poor predictor if you did not get a seizure you do not have a seizure disorder
10656,hsv igm means an acute exposure igg is a chronic state sounds like possible acute exposure to hsv may need a repeat
10657,hsv testing igm is the first antibody type to be produced in an immune reaction to a foreign invader such as a virus over time  the igm response changes to igg some tests will examine igm to determine if the infection is new recent  some tests look at igg to see if there is evidence of an older infection or exposure the physician selects the appropriate test depending upon the question they need answered
10658,herpes it is not a recent exposure you have genital herpes
10659,hsv and pregnancy so  it appears that you have been exposed to both hsv type 1 and 2 and harbor genital herpes virus hsv 2 which your baby can contract its been shown that if you have no active outbreak of hsv 2 around the time of your labor  your baby is safe if you do have such outbreak and your baby is being delivered  he she may acquire the virus and develop complications
10660,3 months if you have been tested 3 months after your potential exposure then you did not acquire the infection and the tests are reliable
10661,hsv1  no hsv2 the results mean you are carrying herpes simplex virus type 1 hsv1  usually from oral infection in childhood  so you probably have had it for years but if you have had symptoms that suggest genital herpes  it could be a genital infection you do not have hsv2  the usual cause of genital herpes i takes up to 12 weeks for positive results  so these results do not exclude recent infection
10662,early vs late igm is the immunoglobulin noted for coming out early in response to any illness  it fades over time while igg come out a bit later and stays up longer if you have a positive igm it indicates a early response  while igg would probably show up in a few months at which point the igm would have declined
10663,herpes simplex this generally refers to the infection that occurs when you are exposed to the virus for the first time this is indicated by the presence of igm antibodies in the absence of igg antibodies you can also have acute infection with recurrence  but then you would also have igg antibodies present as well as igm you cannot reliably separate types 1  2 using antibody testing
10664,yes yes  that is standard for testing igg will be positive in the case of an old infection  igm will be positive and igg negative for a new infection
10665,see below means you have been exposed and had herpes simplex type 1 virus in the past mouth herpes which most everyone in the world gets exposed to in the 1st 5 years of life no worries unless you are immunocompromised or are getting cold sores all the time if so meds might be warranted talk to your doc
10666,see your doctor see your doc for a physical examination and some tests to evaluate the blood in your stool
10667,why wonder these symptoms call for a physician evaluation including a good pelvic exam be brave  get seen  and best wishes
10668,possible  but bloating  alternating diarrhea and constipation  pelvic pressure could go along with ovarian cancer  but truly it is more likely to be due to an intestinal issue irritable bowel syndrome  diverticulitis  problems digesting some food  pelvic infection are all possible i recommend you get seen and examined an ultrasound will let you know if there is an ovarian problem
10669,best see your doctor rather than take something go see your doctor with these symptoms

10675,anxiety see a pcp anxiety symptoms are not a sign of illness  they are the minds ability to produce the flight or fight response which gives rise to many physiological changes include chest pains  air in my mouth  dry mouth  aphasia  tremor and sweating depending on the cause of your anxiety symptoms  your health care provider can recommend appropriate treatment
10676,hard to say you have quite a variety of symptoms which could be from many many different causes it sounds like you have seen at least one medical doctor and had some superficial testing done i would encourage you to see a primary care physician who can manage or care instead of seeking treatment at urgent care facility or emergency department then if specialty consultation such as ent   gastroenterology is needed your primary care physician can arrange theseyour constellation of symptoms however does not point to a specific diagnosis and i think you need to seek medical attention
10677,pcp time to see pcp or ent
10678,further evaluation a ct scan shows no structural problems  ecg shows no arrhythmias but this does not mean he has no problems there are many possible causes that need evaluation intestinal parasites  food allergies  other chronic infections  thyroid imbalances  nutrient deficiencies  environmental toxins etc ideally he should see a holistic doc or at least one who will consider and test for these possibilities

10680,recurrent yeast vaginal yeasts are rarely acquired from other persons yeasts are normal in our intestines and often in the vagina new yeast symptoms are not from a new infection  but because your own natural yeast has grown to increased numbers and or the body is having an allergylike reaction to it if symptoms recur frequently  talk with your doc about preventing them with a diflucan dose once a week
10681,depends chronic yeast can indicate higher sugar levels  resistant yeast or too much acidity from diet  stress  medications consider getting your sugar levels checks  a culture of the yeast to confirm how to treat it  manage stress  continuing or changing the probiotics to something stronger  eating a more alkaline diet and using ph drops to improve acid base balance
10682,i would not i would not take diflucan if i did not need it
10683,no fluconazole interacts with many medications and therefore should be used only to treat active infections unless a patient is immunosuppressed yogurt with active cultures or lactobacillus acidophilus supplements can help some people prevent yeast infections especially during courses of antibiotics also keep yeastprone areas dry by using zeasorb or other powders over the counter is helpful
10684,see doctor you then need a prescription
10685,yes benadryl and diflucan do not cause problems when taken together
10686,diflucan is an rx some say tea tree oil or garlic supplements help with yeast infections but there isnt a very good body of research to really recommend this from a medical standpoint you do have to see your doctor for diflucan as it is a prescription it doesnt hurt to be examined anyways  in the case that its actually something other than a yeast infection
10687,well lotrimin vaginal is available and gentle and effective
10688,usually takes about 4 days to see improvement if no improvement see your doctor
10689,fluconazole a yeast infection usually resolves in one to two weeks with appropriate treatment it may take longer for those who are immunocompromised

10692,possible allergy this may be an acute allergic reaction which might be treatable with a variety of meds  but first needs to be seen and diagnosed by a physician since without being able to examine you would only be guessing that this is the cause go and be seen and hope it clears up quickly
10693,candida glabrata the usual cause of vaginal yeast infections is candida albicans however  c glabrata causes 1015% of infections  and many c glabrata strains are resitant to the azole drugs see your doctor and ask about alternative treatments  such as nystatin  flucytosine  or caspofungin

10701,probably not kidney infections usually cause fevers and back pain if you still have some symptoms  you should go back and get retested you may need a different antibiotic  or you might not be emptying your bladder completely when you do urinate  which is trapping bacteria in the bladder good luck
10702,other antibiotics depends on the bacteria that you have got  your doctor can prescribe other antibiotics  hopefully wont cause you an allergic reaction  if an antibiotic is badly needed and no other alternative is available  you can still have it in consultation with an allergist for a process called desensitization  but thats rarely resorted to  good luck
10703,here are some generally speaking  nitrofurantoin is still a good timetested antibiotics for uncomplicated urine tract infection although it has been used for decades so  it was want to take it if no allergy to it more ask doc timely best wish 
10704,maybe several things are possible you could have a case of prostatitis that requires a longer course of antibiotics for a cure you could be on the wrong antibiotic check to see if a urine culture was done and that you are on the proper antibiotic if you are not emptying your bladder  you could predispose yourself to a bladder infection and it could be more difficult to clear the infection

10709,chest pain you certainly want to be sure the pain is not cardiac in nature  so consult with your doctor immediately the location of the pain  combined with your young age  makes this unlikely  but you want to get to the bottom of it sometimes  gallbladder or biliary problems cause this type of pain  as do some lung disorders consult with your doctor
10710,many causes get it checked locally

10766,temporary strain in all likelihood you slept with your hand arm twisted or compressed some way in bed this is very common you may have compressed a nerve if you have not experienced this before it can be surprising how long the discomfort can last once you are up and moving it into different positions it should not last a day if it does  or longer especially  see you doctor for evaluation good wishes:
10767,it could be broken i personally have had broken hand bones and didnt know it until later when i had an xray it may be a good idea to see a doctor for an xray  just to be sure
10768,hand surgeon there are several issues that could cause your symptoms the best care would be to have a hand surgeon evaluate you with additional imaging such as an xray continuing gymnastics without an evaluation could lead to further injury
10769,see a dr asap this sounds like a nerve problem  may be chronic neck problem or a recent onset  depends of more history  either way get an appointment with a spine   orthopedics specialists

10772,get xray likely its a radial nerve bruise  but xrays would be needed to make sure not a break
10773,varies it varies somewhat  based upon the specific cause it might be reasonable to ice it down and rest it  if it does resolved over 35 days it probably was a minor injury if it does not get better  or worsens at any point  i would not hesitate to be seen for it
10774,it could be but it could be a good ole bruise which takes a while to maximun mas swelling after most injuries does not arrive until ~ 5 days post injury if you are concerned then you should see someone for eval and probably an xray
10775,cartilage damage you could have an internal derangement that is causing your clicking and pain if you havent had it checked out yet  see an orthopedic specialist he will need to know when the clicking occurs and what things make your knee feel worse you may need xrays and possibly an mri

10779,nope your doctor told you that time to find another doctor masturbation does not cause anything but an orgasm and ejaculation period
10780,is the doc right your sexual activity cannot change your testosterone level this is absurd i believe there are two issues here your sexual activity  which is normal and common and of no concern to any one medically masturbation is a normal human experience and  if you have male pattern baldness this is evidence of genetic predisposition much more than any comment about your testosterone level
10781,myths i am sorry to report but your doctor has given you inaccurate and untrue myths this physician told you myths that are completely untrue and repeatedly proven to be false i would avoid any further contact with this physician they do not have your best interests at heart masturbation does not in any way have any correlation to hair loss period true scientific
10782,wrong ejaculation doesnt cause baldness  or blindness or acne or callouses or anything of the sort its a genetic thing you inherited from your parents  the baldness  that is  not the ejaculation  you come by that yourself
10783,no have fun and remember your partner next to you is not there because of your hair keep perspective my man
10784,unclear what is internal shaking at 42 low testosterone a mainly male hormone is unusual see an endocrinilogist

10789,masturbate 1: stop it 2: see a psychologist to explain why you are masturbating regularly 3: see a dermatologist about your hair loss
10790,pimples how old are you they both can be related to male hormone changes at adolescence
10791,all normal young men often get acne for several years the length of time a person suffers from acne  and severity of the acne are largely genetic  and not caused by poor hygiene or a bad dietor by masterbation or being aroused a little leakage of semen sperm prior to ejaculation is also normal this is why prevention of pregnancy requires placing the condom as soon as the penis is erect
10792,hair loss  ferritin it is common for women with ferritin lower than around 50 to have hair shedding if there is also a rash with dry itchy skin and tiredness  this needs to be evaluated by a dermatologist as there may be other causes for the hair loss iron levels need to be monitored if you are taking iron supplementation because too much iron may be harmful to the liver
10793,slow down tex i think you are answering your own question if you are masturbating enough to make your penis hurt i would back off on frequency   intensity   duration until that is not the case masturbation is a healthy thing but the penis itself is still a soft organ and you can hurt it unlikely to do permanent damage but still
10794,probably not clear discharge is common  and if your nipple is only inverted some of the time  thats probably just how you are built however  anything unusual that occurs only in one breast is worth getting checked there is a myth that women your age dont get breast cancer its less common  but it does happen see a doctor for a breast exam as a first step
10795,not likely very unlikely breast cancer based on age alone not normal  however should see gyn or other md
10796,most likely hormonal near your menstrual cycle the breast may become sensitive other reasons may be caffeine sensitivity or mastitis depending on your age you may need a exam and or mammogram
10797,linked to periods often your breasts can become tender with cyclic hormonal changes in your body you can take motrin for symptomatic control if it persists > 34 months  see a doctor for further evaluation
10798,breast lumps finding a lump in the breast will always cause anxiety and fear of cancer in fact most lumps are benign but it is very important to be evaluated by your dr and get appropriate imaging to be cetain
10799,see a doctor for a physical examination fortunately most breast lumps are benign fibrocystic nodules or cysts in women under the age of 40 but without an examination and possibly a breast ultrasound and mammogram you cannot tell please have her get an examination with a doctor
10800,could be anytime there is a missed period in a sexually active female  there is a possibility of pregnancy best to take a pregnancy test to see
10801,yes you need to do a pregnancy test  but either way  need to get the discharge checked out
10802,wait to repeat test wait one week and repeat the pregnancy test
10803,sounds like it better head over to labor and delivery
10804,period soon might be about to start your 1st period after deep
10805,normal white spots on the nipples and areola are called montgomery tubercles and are normal
10806,not about the spots but if there is a family history of br ca  you may need closer surveillance the spots are likely just areas with less pigment
10807,see dr you need to see your ob gyn dr as it sounds like you have an infection  and being pregnant you definately need to be evaluated and treated approriately good luck
10808,possible infection thick colored discharge that burns is certainly sending up a red flag for an infection  and if you are pregnant  any infection down there can be dangerous for you and the baby you need to see your ob this week and get this checked out before you end up in premature labor or having a baby that is at risk for catching that infection during birth dont delay
10809,maybe anything is possible  best way to know for sure is a urine or blood pregnacy test
10810,neurology sounds to me like you should be under the care of a neurologist if you dont have one already the reason for the lesion in your brain should be elucidated
10811,maybe ok depending on the size and location   these lesions are also common in normal persons  aging  and those with migraine but discuss with a neurologist to make sure
10812,no this would be a very atypical presentation for a brain tumor  and the expense and effort of an mri would be most unlikely to find something treatable and will distract you from finding the real cause of your symptoms if alls normal  remember that functional illness is real  and many achesandpains never yield their cause but also never progress
10813,not likely necessary brain tumors are uncommon in people your age  and the symptoms you describe are not at all suspicious for a brain tumor you may have a problem with your peripheral nerves neuropathy ask to see a neurologist who specializes in such disorders
10814,neurologist i am presuming you are seeing a neurologist for this level of problem if your mri scans are totally normal that would make ms unlikely  if your symptoms are stable and not changing  moving that also makes it unlikely see a neurologist or  if you already have  see another for a second opinion
10815,parasthsias on one side of the body may be due to tia  focal seizure or migraine random crawling sensation on scalp hands arms and legs is often do to fleas making their last stand in homes with pets this time of year in northern climates
10816,tingling could be spine related pressure on nerves of neck and lower back see your physician
10817,recommend: your symptoms are nonspecific and could be due to many conditions mri lesions could be due to migraine or prior head injuries  and your doctor could describe whether the pattern is consistent with a specific cause i no longer use evoked potentials to confirm ms  and rarely use for any reason if things seem unclear  a lumbar puncture may be useful discuss all of this with neurologist
10818,ms evaluation the way you classify your symptoms is worrisome the emg is the next step to pin down the diagnosis you may also need a lumbar puncture if symptoms persist full lab work including evaluation for lyme disease it vit d deficiency b12 folic acid thyroid studies sjogrens syndrome and sarcoid evaluations well if no firm diagnosis is made you may need second opinion
10819,still can be nerves even a mild case of carpal tunnel can be bothersome and sometimes elude emg also may be nothing your radial sensory nerve is right at the location you describe and sits right on top of that bone truth is  i have the same problem as you its like hitting your funny bone
10820,occupational therapy it seems that you are already seeing a neurologist and they have ruled out common neurological causes of wrist and hand pain see an occupational therapist who may be able to help diagnosing such conditions can be challenging and sometimes take several months and repeated follow up in the meanwhile pain management is recommended and various classes of different analgesics may have to be tried
10821,numb you need a good history and exam by a neurologist many possible causes
10822,peripheral nerves your symptoms seem to be more related to a peripheral neuropathy vs myopathy not likely stemming from the central nervous system
10823,incomplete study you link only shows us 3 images a full mri would typically show 50 or more images no gross abnormalities are evident on the 3 images provided
10824,limitations: 1 not viewed on high resolution monitor 2 not compared with older studies other than that i agree  you look fine
10825,serotonin syndrome serotonin syndrome is rare it can occur with changes of medications doses  or with administration of a new drug which increase the level of the other medications by affecting the metabolic pathways  elimination rate  protein binding  or other pharmacological interaction consult with your doctor before taking any new medication or over the counter drugs
10826,see details celebrex can be stopped immediately if the dose of gabapentin is not high it can also be stopped all at once the others can be tapered over 2 or 3 months
10827,withdrawal safest way is gradual tapering your doctor can come up with detailed schedule for each medication to help you gradually discontinue  avoid withdrawal  depending on the dosage of each medication
10828,depends on dx whether you have to have your knee re scoped depends on your present diagnosis  if you have retorn your meniscus then probably yes if your knee is hurting because of concomitant knee pathology  associated arthritic changes then possibly not other treatments may be helpful get a precise diagnosis from your surgeon and realistic expectations of prognosis  best of luck
10829,same and tramadol same is a natural substance that is used for depression and mild pain it clears out in 35 days i think waiting 48 hours is reasonable
10830,usually fine the gabapentin has no appreciable drugdrug interactions  and will not affect the tramadol this combination is usually quite safe and often very effective
10831,yes  but tramadol is a non opioid analgesic being given for moderate to severe pain gabapentin is an anticonvulsant being prescribed for neuropathic type of pain both medications also come in an extended release formulation gabapentin should be taken regularly  while the regular or immediate release tramadol can be taken when one has episodes of moderate to severe pain
10832,treatment failure when a treatment fails to produce the solution to a problem the prescribing physician needs to be notified
10833,yeast start with otc treatment and take a probiotic if its still persistent see your doctor
10834,yes  you can there is n drug interactions between these drugs however  do not start a new medication without telling your doctor  even otc advil
10835,not likely prozac usually clears from the body by two weeks you are not likely to experience serotonin syndrome at this time tramadol by itself  however  can lower the seizure threshold making you at risk to have a seizure if you are not taking it on an ongoing basis  you are safe hope this helps best wishes
10836,yeswatch carefully if you have any of these: confusion  hallucination  seizure  extreme changes in blood pressure  increased heart rate  fever  excessive sweating  shivering or shaking  blurred vision  muscle spasm or stiffness  tremor  incoordination  stomach cramp  nausea  vomiting  or diarrhea  call provider asap and even consider er it can be lifethreatening before starting  talk about it talk tx can help
10837,may be get checked it may be herpes simplex infection or a bacterial infection  you should get it checked asap by your doctor or gynecologist
10838,please see a std clinic or your gynecologist an infection to include a sexually transmitted disease needs to be ruled out take care
10839,seek medical advice discharge needs to be evaluated  may need std testing please seek medical advice for eval
10840,one possibility bacterial vaginosis is one possibility please get this checked by your gynecologist or your family doctor
10841,unlikely but without being able to examine you and obtain a full history with knowledge of your sexual activities it is not possible to say with any degree of certainty go and see your pcp or a gynecologist and let them have a look at this
10842,see doctor if by sti you mean a sexually transmitted infection like syphilis the answer is yes however there are other things than can cause red lesions and a sore throat consult a dentist and a physician as soon as possible especially if you suspect having a sexally transmitted infection  get tested for hiv infection also avoid all sexual contact until ok by doctor
10843,purple marks on lips you have to see your doctor or a dermatologist to have a proper diagnosis there are a number of different possibilities the most likely is a vascular one such as a venous lake however many lesions on the lips can reflect a systemic condition like oslerweberrendu
10844,venous lake venous lakes are benign blood vessel growths that can be blue or purple in color on the lips see a dermatologist to evaluate the lesion they can also be removed by an oral surgeon if they are bothersome
10845,probably not  but assuming your doctor is experienced in recognizing herpes  i see no reason to doubt her diagnosis and advice however  even the most expert doctors sometimes mistake herpes for other things  and vice versa no other std is a likely cause of symptoms like these if you have other reasons to suspect std  like a known infected partner  discuss it further with your doctor good luck
10846,hard to say without a picture however if your doctor who saw the rash gave you a topical antibiotics for irritation and it is effective  i have no basis to second guess his assessment if concerned about std request testing and practice safe sex
10847,hsv2 are you sexually active it could be herpes simplex 2 primary infection get checked out by your gynecologist
10848,infection uti yes it surely suggest you have a vaginal infection with urinary tract infection  whether it is std can only be detected by exam and culture of the discharge and urine i will suggest you get it checked by your family doctor or gynecologist
10849,not enough info to know if you have a change in color  texture  odor or amount of vaginal discharge  problems such as pain  itching burning with urination or sex or redness swelling then it is best to see your gynecologist for evaluation  accurate assessment
10850,no no it will not
10851,uti yes  yeast can ascend into bladder and irritated skin can harbor bacteria that can ascend into the bladder
10852,no yeast infection can sometimes come from the good bacteria being killed by antibiotics meant to treat a uti uti is a bacterial overgrowth in the bladder or urinary tract and is not related to yeast in any other way
10853,tell your doctor your health care providers need to know that you are getting yeast infections after antibiotics  specifically the pcn  so they can give you a prescription for a medication that can prevent it from happenning again some patients benefit from using otc monistat at the end of treatment with antibiotics or when they start having first signs of discomfort however  some will need prescription med
10854,probiotics if you will eat a six ounce carton of yogurt with active cultures  drink eight ounces of buttermilk or take a probiotic daily while taking your penicillin this will decrease  but not eliminate the possibility of getting a vaginal yeast infection
10855,could be this could very well be related to a yeast infection so you could try for example clotrimazole or monistat over the counter however  this could be associated to other infections so would be prudent to see gyn provider for exam my other advise is to get a pregnancy test if you had unprotected sex
10856,ouch hi alice 646 cramping can sometimes follow more than usually vigorous intercourse  and as long as it doesnt last long and you have no other gi or vaginal pain  is probably functional unfortunately  penile vaginal intercourse can lead to yeast infections as well as frictional trauma consider using a lubricant treat the yeast  and consider condoms or a shared shower before intercourse
10857,unlikely soap and water may reduce chance
10858,good hygiene  etc the best way to prevent this is probably good hygiene  like douching regularly and showering regularly it would also help to lessen the frequency of sex give your body a chance to rest and recover
10859,unlikely as above
10860,yes any prolonged antibiotic use can lead to a yeast infection suggest avoid long term abx use
10861,i would not i would not take diflucan if i did not need it
10862,no fluconazole interacts with many medications and therefore should be used only to treat active infections unless a patient is immunosuppressed yogurt with active cultures or lactobacillus acidophilus supplements can help some people prevent yeast infections especially during courses of antibiotics also keep yeastprone areas dry by using zeasorb or other powders over the counter is helpful
10863,medical evaluation see a doctor to evaluate and treat you
10864,not the vaccine the vaccine didnt cause your symptoms you likely have a viral infection  or strep throat if symptoms dont improve call your dr for a strep screen
10865,viral your symptoms are not due to the vaccine it sounds as if you may have the flu
10866,could be you need a throat culture you dont want to mess with step see you doc tomorrow or monday mononucleosis is another possibility
10867,viral pharyngitis sounds like you have a cold sometimes it attacks the throat more than the nose generally though you will have some nasal congestion and sneezing aswell  and then cough if the pain gets worse or your throat looks bright red i would see your primary doctor to check for strep  otherwise acetaminophen or ibuprofen  lots of water and rest is the best thing
10868,viral illness with those symptoms and a negative strep  this illness is likely caused by one of many viruses that are circulating around the country thats good news and bad news good news is you dont need any medicines to treat it  your body will do that for you bad news is you have to rest and take care of yourself for a few days so your body can fight the infection rest  fluids  and tlc to yourself
10869,call peds needs checked for strep throat not absolute  but possible call your pediatrician many kids with strep will have nausea or vomiting
10870,yes given the symptoms and the fact you had a close contact with streo it is likely you may have strep get checked out and have a rapid strep test performed
10871,viral or strep this could be a viral or strep infection have a rapid screening throat culture for strep where you will get an answer within 15 to 30 minutes if the test is negative and symptoms persist a more accurate routine throat culture can be done with results in 1 to 2 days
10872,yes but also need to check that this was not strep  but infectious mononucleosis see your primary care physician hope you are better quickly
10873,could be the family transfer rate runs ~1 4 at this time of the yr less likely >24hr of meds but you both may have been exposed to the same source or he could pass it to you before rx a quick strep test with a culture if that is negative  few false neg tests occur will let u knowgreat handwashing  lack of oral contact keeps transfer rate down  a difficult thing in families
10874,possibly you do have positive contact possibly from kissing your child many times a day as i did when mine were little call your doc to have a rapid strep test done in the office you will have an answer in about 5 minutes in the meantime  motrin or excedrine may help with the headaches good luck
10875,strep exposure despite your exposure to strep  you still need a throat culture to verify the diagnosis see your doctor
10876,see your doctor and get checked for strep it may be viral and strep
10877,fever again ahhhhh  different picture now with the history of chronic ear infection  his ears need to be looked at before assuming the fever is caused by a virus make an appointment today
10878,urine if urine culture was adequately done and is negative  then your symptoms are not due to urinary tract infection you may have a vaginal issue yeast infection or bladder spams that can cause similar symptoms
10879,check with your dr sometimes doctors treat uti without doing a culture  which means that maybe your antibiotic is resistant to your strain of bacteria and yore not feeling better because antibiotic cant treat the infection check with your doctor to make sure a culture was done and that your bacteria is sensitive to the antibiotic yore on
10880,urinary urinary tract infection uti and bladder infection are the same symptoms include burning or stinging with urination  increased urinary frequency  difficulty starting the urine stream  and blood or discolored smelly urine progressing signs to a kidney infection include fevers  chills  and low back pain you should seek medical attention if you think you might have a uti  to be appropriately treated
10881,burning urgency freq dysuria or burning on urination  the need to urinate urgently  urgency the need to urinate frequently  frequency are the most common signs of a urinary tract infection if the infection is in the kidney pain in the flank or back  fever and chills are common uti encompasses both bladder and kidney infections
10882,treatment failure when a treatment fails to produce the solution to a problem the prescribing physician needs to be notified
10883,several if not pregnant  you cannot have ectopic pregnancy what other signs pain can come from lots of things  pelvic infection  urinary tract infection  ovarian cysts etc pelvic exam with gyn is best bet
10884,pregnant ectopic repeat home test for pregnancy if you have ectopic pregnancy  the test should be positive you should call your doctor to be examined for your abdominal pain  as there are many possibilities for the cause
10885,many possibilities you may or may not have symptoms when you carry a std you can also carry more than 1 at a time i would have it checked out as you both may have at least chlamydia if not that plus gonorrhea and or other possibilities
10886,weird down there weird is not in any way a medical word it is not descriptive or specific enough to even begin to comment on medically
10887,throat infection this probably was a viral infection of the throat and the bacteria which grew in the culture were most likely only colonizing the throat rather than being an invasive infection the throat infection should resolve without specific treatment after a few days your physician can advise you best  however as he she knows all your findings
10888,may not especially after the antibiotics i would see your primary doctor if it persists you may need an ultrasound
10889,bladder irritability symptoms similar to those of a urinary trat infection may ocur from bladder irritability this may be brought on my very acidic foods  coffee  alcohol  colas  and very spicy foods for beverages  switch to plain water be sure than you have had a recent urinary culture  however
10890,yes you can have a yeast infection in urine without vaginal or vulvar symptoms see a physician for follow up of your condition
10891,mucocoeles clear filled bumps or bubbles are often mucocoeles  which often do not need treatment to know for sure you really need to see a dentist a dentist can see for sure what this may be it truly is too difficult to say for sure through solely a question on this website
10892,blocked duct they are probably just some minor salivary glands that are filling up with saliva because the duct opening is clogged
10893,maybe folliculitis needs to be seen by your doctor to be sure what they are
10894,cannot diagnose without the ability to examine these after obtaining a full history  it would be foolish to try and predict what these might be see your doctor or perhaps a dermatologist
10895,many possibles most likely these are hair follicles have they always been there  or is it something new have your doctor look at them if yore worried  or if they spread or hurt
10896,here are some  a combo of detailed hx + physical exams will definitely solve the conundrum of guessing game clinically  these bumps may present small hyperactive sebaceous glands related with hair follicles  which could be effectively treated of course  some sorts of eczema or yeast infection or  are possible so  seek a professional evaluation best wishes 
10897,two issues #1 you may have a vaginal bacterial infection that may need rx by a mdmusky fishy smell # 2 the pubic hair bumps need to be checked by a md to determine exactly what they are
10898,check it out could be due to positioning of neck for filling may want to see your chiropractor first
10899,not related this is most likely coincidental  the anesthesia on the upper would not affect the lowe lip or jaw you should go back to your dentist and have him check it out there must be another reason
10900,folliculitis definitely sounds like folliculitis try better shaving technique make sure to use hot water to open pores and try shaving daily with a sharp blade to prevent curly beard hair from growing back into skin which can set up these types of reactions moisturize area after each shave to keep skin healthy if there are signs of infection might need topical bacterial ointment
10901,genital area bumps many diagnoses include the presence of bumps on the genitalia  and you need to see a dermatologist to look at these things and tell you what they are
10902,many causes first make sure that you dont have a problem with dry skin use cetaphil or dove soap and apply a moisturizer
10903,get checked out sounds like you may have folliculitis an inflammation   infection of the hair follicles or seborrheic dermatitis see a dermatologist for proper diagnosis and treatment both conditions respond well to treatment
10904,psoriasis psoriasis involves both these areas and could fit with this description there are many different prescription creams as wells intralesional treatment which can help this condition an effective over the counter product to alleviate the symptoms is scytera foam if the response is inadequate see dermatologist for evaluation amd treatment
10905,many things rashes can be caused by many things the areas where you describe the rash sounds like it could be psoriasis but you would need an evaluation by a doctor to determine for sure unfortunately rashes have to be seen to be diagnosed and treated i would seek care with your doctor and if necessary  see a dermatologist skin specialist
10906,dermatitis the rash on your back may be due to cintact dermatitisor possibly sweat dermatitis caused by your sinus infection which may be making you perspire try to dressin cool pajamas and use a moisturizer for your back
10907,dry skin there are a couple of reasons that could be responsible dermatitis from change in shampoo sunburn to scalp excessive use of hairdryer
10908,contact dermatitis use of some hair products can provoke itching even without a rash changing to hypoallergenic shampoos and conditioners may help
10909,most likely  ok as long as no local discomfort  such rashes may suggest mild balanitis inflammation of glans penis  which is usually related with redundant foreskin with poor local hygiene without detailed history and inspection  its hard to make a firm statement if any doubt  go to see an expert in the field best luck
10910,see your doctor you could be having a reaction to something you have come into contact with  change in hygiene or laundry product  or a yeast infection it is best to see your doctor to make sure it is nothing serious  and he she will most likely prescribe a steroid cream to treat it unless it is an infection  then you will need antibiotics
10911,depends if it is uncomfortable  you should go to doctor  it can be a cyst  and it might be infected or it can get infected  or it might be a lymph node and signify some kind of infection in the area in any case it is better to take care of it earlier before it becomes a bigger problem
10912,lip licking eczema certain individuals tends to lick their lips as habit or to moisten it from repeated cracking  malocclusion or open mouth breathing or misaligned braces tend to worsen it please visit your md for a quick check and treatment  regards
10913,dentist this could be a simple condition or something serious the important thing is to see a dentist the sooner a diagnosis is made  the sooner a definitive treatment can be started if needed with better outcome some causes of this are bony protrusions  mucocele   epstein pearls  or oral cancer see your dentist sooner than later
10914,not recommended this is not recommended there are many over the counter yeast infection meds that will help and have been studied for safety by the fda rx meds are also available  even as a 1 time dose good luck
10915,probably safe but why on earth would you do this i am unable to find a study of this  but garlic is not likely to successfully treat yeast infections  and if you enjoy oral sex nobody is likely to come near you it will not be likely to harm you  but is worthless therapeutically there are so many effective therapies  several otc  that you should stay with proven methods of cure good luck
10916,no benefit the garlic is not going to rid you of the yeast it probably would not hurt the vagina  but it would not be of any benefit
10917,treat infection you put it on the spots where you are infected
10918,yes if you have a vaginal as well as vulvar infection it should be applied both places if you do nt have an applicator then its for outside only
10919,not necessarily but  anytime that one is not positive that what they are suffering from is a yeast infection  that warrants medical evaluation
10920,yes its safe  but you would need a good reason to restart it if you are having frequent yeast infections  you might think about having some lab work done to check for diabetes
10921,yes bcp do not make u get yeast infections  they only stop ovulation look 4 another cause
10922,yes this can certainly occur but it is not caused by bcps it can happen anytime  and bcps will not prevent it either
10923,yeast no it is not common  unless your partner is cheating but you need a chlamydia test to rule out chlamydia
10924,no no
10925,yes certainly this can occur and sometimes taking an antibiotic care suit is vaginal yeast infection get checked by your medical provider if you have symptoms
10926,sounds like it obviously we can not confirm without an exam but yeast is the logical conclusion try an over the counter yeast cream
10927,go see your doctor your family doctor can help you determine if your symptoms are related to generalized anxiety disorder  allergies  cold  etc based upon diagnosis  your doc can then discuss appropriate options w you
10928,could be either they symptoms are likely related to an upper respiratory infection however depending on the time sequence and persistence of symptoms  allergies could be playing a role if there is no improvement in the near future should the symptoms persist or should they worsen  i recommend seeing your primary doctor and possibly an allergist
10929,ask your voice coach that is a question for your voice coach
10930,it can be difficult to distinguish between the onset of a cold  virus  and allergies allergists often perform a special nasal discharge smear and stain and look for allergy cells under the microscopeyour pcp can help u figure this out
10931,maybe its worth a try
10932,a cold a viral infection is the most likely answer unless it persists beyond 10 days and starts to itch
10933,ritalin anxiety talk to your doctor about slowrelease forms of ritalin or adding a supplement for anxiety  such as kapvay or clonidine
10934,several possibilitie this could represent a common cold  bronchitis  allergies or even pneumonia for definitive diagnosis and treatment  you need to see your doctor without a fever  this likely has a viral etiology so antibiotics may not be necessary or helpful
10935,chest congestion the symptons you describe suggest that you may have a viral or bacterial upper respritory infection which may be accompanied by sinusitis and or bronchitis  you need to be evaluated by you physician  who will examine you and determine the choice of treatment  you will need decogestants with cogh medicine and you may or may not need antibiotics  it can also be complicated with pneumonia  so see your md
10936,allergy hello im not sure what your question is however your symptoms do suggest allergy a trial of zyrtec or allegra may prove to help more than claritin also see your doctor who may wish to refer for testing or try other prescription medication good luck
10937,not much gentle suctioning of nose and running humidifier especially during the night will relieve the discomfort otc or prescription cold meds do not make much difference seek a medical attention if she develops heavy breathing  fever of over 101f  or fussiness

10948,postconcussion syndrome can occur after even mild trauma to the brain a list of symptoms  including dizziness  pain  anxiety  depression is on http:  wwwhealthlinecom health postconcussionsyndrome#prevention7 see your doctor for evaluation  treatment or referral to a neurologist  as symptoms can last for several weeks  even months avoid reinjury

11112,neck or shoulder pain in scapular area or between neck and shoulder is likely coming from your neck pain in your upper arm that goes down the upper arm toward the elbow could be from your shoulder or your neck i recommend you consult with an orthopedic surgeon for evaluation and treatment options
11113,recommend evaluation make sure you dont have a postconcussive headache
11114,time for a massage sounds like your trapezius and rhomboid muscles are strained and spasming this is an unhappy feeling because the nerves that course through these muscles get pinched and result in the feeling of pain not to fear  these symptoms can be remedied by a little bit of intense therapy  and perhaps medication it is best to see your doctor to get an idea of this or email me
11115,pinched nerve because patients having cardiac problems can have these symptoms  you should have this ruled out but the most common cause is an irritation of a nerve in the neck by a bone spur or herniation that can cause pain or numbness that runs down the arm into the hand an mri can usually show the cause of the problem if it does not resolve thank you for the question
11116,get checked see a neck specialist first
11117,see a doctor the symptoms you describe might resolve spontaneously however  you symptoms are consistent with cervical nerve root impingement therefore  it would be wise for you to see your doctor for an evaluation and possible referral to a specialist
11118,see your doctor you are describing a lot of vague symptoms  but some are concerning this could potentially be from a pinched nerve  or something more serious see your doctor to be evaluated further best wishes
11119,see doctor for a thorough evaluation to determine the cause of your symptoms
11120,muscular if you have not suffered any injuries this is most likely related to a muscle spasm ice and antiinflammatory medslike ibuprofen should help with symptoms if you have suffered recent head or neck injury go to the nearest urgent care center for evaluation
11121,muscle strain spasm you should be examiimined however this sound like a muscle spasm i suggest the immediate use of advil or aleve  if not allergic plus eith bengay  local heat or my preference: biofreeze  until you can be seen or evaluated if symtoms worsen or associated with nauseavomitinggo to a uc clinc or er call for an appointment asap
11122,dont worry 80% of sore throats are caused by virus and need no treatment strep throat will not get better on its own without antibiotics as yours did  which just supports the fact it is likely from a virus your sore throat is gone  and also any risk of rheumatic fever
11123,viral it is possible you have a viral illness and abx may not help in some cases there can be a resistant organism how high is the fever  take rest plenty of fluids and fever medications if fever is high and symptoms get worse contact your md
11124,bronchitis this is virus caused in >95% of cases if you are wheezing and having any respiratory insufficiency difficulty breathing you should see a pulmonologist asap good luck and get better
11125,definitely bronchitis symptoms are usually cough and wheezing in a nonsmoker it is almost always viral and antibiotics are not useful if your wheezing and cough are bad and you are low on oxygen then the doctor may prescribe a steroid and inhaler to help you breathe better it is also possible that you have pneumonia see a doctor tomorrow for exam
11126,viral infection viral infection might cause all these symptoms sore throat might cause pressure imbalance in middle ear visit a doctor to assist you and give you antibiotics and everything is going to be okay within 2 weeks depends on the antibiotic course
11127,could be strep throat  or a viral infection of the throat see a doctor and have this checked good luck
11128,needs visualization this requires an examination and direct visualization of your lesion to be more certain of what it is and how to go about managing it can you open your mouth as widely as this lady in the picture can geezei think i can see all the way to hodgeville  ky down there good luck
11129,possible it is possible but it could be many other things even besides an infection  like allergies and post nasal drip or heartburn i wouldnt race to a doctor  see how things go  if fever follows or worsen see a doctor
11130,call your doctor white spots in the back of the throat could be pockets of pus from a pharyngitis you should call your doctor  you may benefit from a course of antibiotics
11131,doctor can check new throat pain can be from a strep throat infection antibiotics are needed  a cold or influenza antibiotics usually not used  or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants usually  a person sees the doctor if the sore throat is bothersome  recurrent  or doesnt go away quickly mainly to check for strep throat throat lozenges and tylenol or motrin can help decrease throat pain
11132,good news and bad the features you mention along with no big lymph nodes makes strep throat unlikely unfortuantely this does not mean you dont have one of many other infections exam and looking for gunk down the back of the throat or behind the ears is needed
11133,infection although ths is likely viral   strep can present without pusutles on the tonsils probably worth getting swabbed
11134,pharyngitis pharyngitis see md you may need antibiotics
11135,ive had a cough and sore throat first  any high fevers second   cough loose what color phlegm or dry   hacking cough i are you getting any sinus pressure or headaches couple of things before seeing doctor first  warm compresses to the face saline nasal spray increase humidification  hot showers  vaporizer gargle with warm  salty water this might be viral or sinus with some bronchitis if not better  then see dr
11136,rather safe nicotine isnt a particularly concerning chemical in liver disease if you have to choose your ills nicotine gum is safer than smoking cigarettes milk thistle  which is often combined with choline  is also relatively well tolerated it does have some side effects mostly benign gastrointestinal upsetwhich even a sugar pill can causeif you dont have liver disease is less clear of a benefit
11137,not good long term best if you limit sugars  exercise and try apple cider vinegar 1 tbsp twice daily mixed with 8 oz water 1 hr before meals ok to use milk thistle but i would take a week off every few weeks
11138,rare rare rare one single pill will most likely cause no liver trouble diflucan is a very effective treatment for vaginal yeast infection for 2 reasons not only does it take care of the vaginal yeast overgrowth which causes terrible itching it also kills off bowel yeast which may feed into future yeast infections it is a very safe medication  and works very well for yeast infection
11139,very uncommon the possibility of liver irritation is more for those who are on this medication chronically it is safe to take to get rid of your yeast infection
11140,indications there are very specific indications for medical marijuana  and very specific forms that work better than others it doesnt mean that were all free to toke up whenever we want
11141,sure there is no problem with this
11142,yes you can yes you can  there is no contraindication
11143,yes there are no reported drug interactions between these medications the flexeril could make you drowsy and sometime the cymbalta makes people drowsy i would avoid driving or operating machinery in case you are one of those people that it makes drowsy
11144,yes having fibroids would not impact effectiveness of medical abortion it may even be slightly safer than surgical abortion depending on the size and location of the fibroids and the experience of the doctor performing it
11145,not fda tested it should not hurt  although this vitamin concoction has not been tested by the fda for safety and efficacy so  take it at your own risk if you must  but really the only ingredient that i could recommend is the folic acid at 15 mg daily to prevent preterm birth and fetal anomalies best of luck
11146,try alternative carpal tunnel syndrome is a focal neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist wearing a wrist splint and an injection are typically first line therapies the use of narcotics for this condition is not advised
11147,not necessarily tramadol and hydrocodone which always has acetaminophen tylenolin it  are both for moderate pain some would use tramadol for milder pain  and hydrocodone for more moderate pain they should not be taken at the same time  and actually in some people the tramadol may antagonize the hydrocodone neither has interactions with prednisone you need to ask these questions to the prescriber for answer
11148,aphthous ulcer this is normal in some individuals the stress of an infection can bring about these oral mucosal ulcers keep your mouth clean  avoid aggressive brushing of teeth or foods that irritate the ulcer gargle gently with salt water after every meal these ulcers are self limited and will resolve spontaneously if kept clean
11149,cough the cough mechanism is designed to bring mucus from your bronchial airway and pharyngeal airway to your throat so that you can either swallow or spit it out
11150,post nasal drip if you have a cough  this could be post nasal drip a trial of antihistamines might help if not  think reflux
11151,see someone see a physician or dentist for a diagnosis and advice
11152,apthous ulcer if you are sure that is what it is  try gargling with acidolphilus kenalog in orabase will also ease symptoms and tends to stick on the ulcer
11153,sounds viral but would see your doctor for an exam and history if he she recommends  treatment or further testing it is difficult to know what you mean by blisters and furry
11154,infection this may be aphthous ulcer vs infection related   as you have sore throat and and difficulty swallowing than you should see your doctor you have if recently egd than you may have idea of its finding
11155,very rare i dont believe you should worry about cancer it may be normal bony anatomy that some people have  bu nevertheless  have it evaluated by a dentist
11156,see a dentist it is difficult to diagnose with out a proper examination it sounds like you may have an infected tooth see a dentist for proper diagnosis
11157,needs examination since these types of conditions need to be diagnosed by visualization coupled with a complete health history  i suggest that you call a local oral surgeon for a consultation it may be nothing  but it may also be serious better to have it checked out trying to do this over the internet is not really possible
11158,sore throat see your primary care doctor for throat examination and possible throat culture to r o strep infection
11159,see doctor and be checked for strep
11160,glucosamine has not been shown to be effective in ra if you feel the need to try it  go ahead  no harm done
11161,no diarrhea and abdominal pain has more to do with something going on with the gastrointestinal tract  abdomen than with pregnancy it could be a viral infection
11162,yes yes these can be signs of pregnancy these can also be caused by a multitude of other conditions if one is concerned about pregnancy there are many over the counter available home pregnacny test kits avialable that are sensitive within 5 days of conception
11163,vague symptoms menstrual irregularities like a missed period can occur with an infection or a noninfectious inflammatory process or even psychological trauma anything that alters hormonal balances can do this you might want to use another home pregnancy test on a first am voided urine specimen in a week and make sure  otherwise wait and see what happens next month
11164,home pregnancy tests are very accurate they are the same tests used in a doctors office they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period  if you doubt the result you can repeat it in 12 days if you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection
11165,can do a preg test it can be hard to tell if a woman is pregnant because some of the symptoms seen in early pregnancy can also happen in nonpregnant women a urine pregnancy test gives a reliable result if done correctly one can test about 3 weeks after sex 3 weeks after when conception might have occurred  or 1 week after missing a period an obgyn doctor can evaluate any persistent or worrisome symptoms
11166,missed periods you may have taken pregnancy test too early repeat now to see if you are pregnant either way  call your doctor for a check up
11167,hormonal imbalance menstrual irregularities: menstrual irregularities are not uncommon and anovulatory cycle is a common cause if you miss more than two periods it would be time to see your doctor if you do not wish to be pregnant  use contraception all the time you may consider implanted contraceptive or an iud consult this site for more information on this topic http:  wwwnichdnihgov health topics menstruation conditioninfo pages causesaspx practice safe sex
11168,pregnancy test a missed period could signal pregnancy  and a pregnancy test is needed to diagnosis this if the test is negative and period does not appear  repeat the test in 2 weeks see a doctor if you are pregnant and or your menses does not appear
11169,probably not your breasts are sensitive to hormone changes which start with ovulation about 2 weeks before your period and persist until your next period of course if you do conceive this will continue  but that is what home pregnancy tests are for cramping can occur with ovulation and then again prior to your period and is also not specific for pregnancy
11170,always a chance i suggest you check a pregnancy test i typically suggest not to take a pregnancy test until you miss 7 days of a cycle but you can always take one now and then one later
11171,are you sexually active if yes  please take a home pregnancy test if you have missed your period take care
11172,you tell us doctors do not guess ever please get a pregnancy test
11173,if a female is having her period then she is not pregnancy at that time nausea  fatigue and sore breasts are not uncommon in the premenstrual time frame or during the menstrual period abdominal sounds may be related to movement of gases and liquids in the gi tract
11174,yes the findings on your mri can be associated with back pain and even pain running into the leg there are many non surgical options including medications  physical therapy  chiropractic  and interventional pain management to name a few dont hesitate to be seen
11175,degenerative changes as the spine ages the intervertebral disks can provide less stability this causes more pressure on the facet articulations at the back of each vertebral body they respond by broadening or hypertrophying usually this is asymptomatic but can sometimes cause back pain and stiffness
11176,normal nothing to worry about  essentially normal finding  usually wont cause big problems
11177,mild facet joint i think you meant to type facet joint  not face lumbar mri evaluate the facet joints and can show degenerative changes  fluid in joint  or hyper trophy which is enlargement  and these changes can narrow the spinal canal and   or neural foramen narrowing  where nerve exit the spine
11178,based on symptoms these findings are not very specific these findings only have meaning when they are combined with thorough history and physical exam findings
11179,the lowest two rightvabove your pelvis
11180,l4 and l5 discs the disc between l4l5 is consider to be the lumbar disc l4 and the one between l5s1 is the l5 disc
11181,nonspecific believe it or not  scoliosis does not cause pain for most patients  unless the scoliosis is very severe similarly  a disk bulge is often of no consequence  and is simply a normal finding as we age see a physician consider seeing a neurologist since you have numbness for further evaluation
11182,radiological studies their clinical significance and the necessary treatment options should be discussed with the physician who ordered the study they have all the history  physical examination and now the study to make proper treatment decisions and offer opinions
11183,good good those findings are extremely common in people with no pain at all and no history of pain
11184,there there is no way i can give you an opinion on this matter solely based on the mri results there are many factors to consider here  namely the level intensity of your pain  response to treatment  past medical history  etc this is something that should be discussed with your doctor all the factors should be taken into consideration and the doctor will give you his her opinion  give you all the pros and cons  and answer any questions you have the rest is up to you good luck
11185,experts help i agree with dr jackson in addition  it is best with neck and spine issues to see a specialist such as a spine surgeon or neurosurgeon to give you the most expert advice
11186,the foramen is the opening through which a nerve root exits the spinal canal when it is narrowed  usually by degenerative arthritis and or a disc herniation  it can pinch or squeeze the nerve root going through it  possibly causing symptoms in your case it would be the right l4 nerve root the dural sac is the membrane surrounding the spinal cord
11187,possible ibs is possible   but you need some gi evaluation i would also look into integrative therapy
11188,ibs these can be symptoms consistent with ibs  you can always have another process going on in addition such as infection or food intolerances
11189,hard to say you could have both ibs and travellers diarrhea stool testing could separate the two disorders i would get checked good luck
11190,see your doc could be lots of things from ibs to inflammatory bowel disease  to hernia  gyn issues  diet sensitivity  parasites and others see your doc  get checked out
11191,lots many potential problems appendicitis  diverticulitis meckels tumors adhesions need full history  exa  and some studies to determine best choice
11192,r o ibs ibs is a diagnosis of exclusion iuc crohns dz ibd is inflammation usually dx by bx ibs sx can be managed you need a full exam and blood work especially screen for h pylori can cause halitosis blood  parasite  colonoscopy egd while you are getting these items checked out you should stick to a gluten free diet wholeapproachcom txprobiotics levsin bentyl
11193,not at all stool pattern in ibs runs the entire spectrum from loose  frequent  watery with urgency to hard  lumpy constipation with feeling incompletely evacuated sometimes patients will evolve from one extreme to the other ibs is however a diagnosis of exclusion  so what tests have you had so far to clarify this diagnosis
11194,either or other your symptoms are consistent with both irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease among others i am not sure what physical exam means and it is very important how the stool blood test is done to be accurate start taking a daily fiber supplement and drink plenty of fluid if symptoms persist you need to see a gi specialist and have at least a sigmoidoscopy or short scope
11195,see a gi doctor could be one of a dozen or more things  but irritable bowel syndrome would be high on the list might be giardiasis  and so on and so on see a doctor and be diagnosed
11196,immodium if your doctor approves and used in moderation will help reduce the cramps and pain  diarrhea be careful not to use it longer than recommended by your doctor
11197,see a gastroenterolo if the cat scan is normal and pain and diarrhea is persisting consult a gastroenterologist  as you may have inllammatory bowel disease  irritable bowel syndrome  parasitic infestation like giardia or ameba if you have travelled abroad  lactose intolerance etc you also need a blood test for celiac disease  diabetes mellitus etc
11198,yes clinical findings always lag the findings on the xray in other words at the begging you may be worse than the xray shows and at the end you are better before the xray clears up it may take a few weeks for the xray to be clear after your symptoms have resolved
11199,yeast the chlamydia has been treated but you very likely may also have or gotten a yeast infection given you took an antibiotic
11200,multiple staph types there are multiple types of staph some resistant to certain antibiotics if you see continued spread  tell your doctor he she may need to prescribe a different antibiotic when you first start  preexisting infection may become briefly more visible  but there should not be ongoing spread your new breakout may be for another reasonpossibly reaction to the antibiotic or something else
11201,pneumonia it is possible for this to be normal recovery but that depends in large part on the cause of your pneumonia and whether the infection involved the tracheobronchial tree if the latter you may be having residual recovery of these tissues if this was one of the atypical pneumonias like mycoplasma  chlamydia  legionella  the cough may well go on for weeks
11202,pneumonia recovery this lingering cough can be normal i suggest seeing your pcp sometimes if you have acid reflux gerd  this can worsen after a pneumonia  so make sure your taking your heartburn medication if applicable
11203,morning take the prozac in the morning as sometimes it can affect sleep try melatonin for sleep which is found over the counter however it is best to discuss this with your physician
11204,cough many times after bronchitis pneumonia cough can last for months as your airway linings heal they are very irritated what is known as a beta 2 agonist inhaler can help syndrome known as post infectious tussive syndrome it will get better but can take 36mo in some cases to resolve
11205,bronchitis you maybe suffering from chronic bronchitis after your initial infection  make sure you follow up with your pcp  refrain from smoking in case or any environmental exposures  other possibility is atypical organisms that will give you dry cough etc  symptoms may last a little longer but you should improve soon 
11206,sounds like infection see your doc if pus develops
11207,scratch or abrasion did you break the skin with the clippy if so you may have a small ulcer or abrasion in the area that hurts
11208,you might have persistent infection or kidney stones go back to your doctor for further evaluation it is unusual for men to get uti  and usually requires urology consultation
11209,swollen lymph nodes try consulting with an ear specialist i cannot read the rest of your question
11210,i am concerned intercourse unprotected 2 days before ovulation suggests a possibility of pregnancy if pregnant and implanted poorly or in the tube spotting could go on best to be examined cant rely at this time on a negative pregnancy test
11211,monitor cycle monitor your menstrual cycles and length of bleeding cycle repeat pregnancy test in 2 weeks and consult with your private gyn
11212,takes 3 days can take up to 3 days for symptoms to improve otc monistat works better for symptom relief
11213,several possibilitie among the possibilities: 1 misdiagnosis how was the yeast infection diagnosed 2 coexisting problem ii could be that you have another problem 3 insufficient time it might just take a little longer for the yeast infection to respond to diflucan i suggest seeing your doctor for reevaluation and management
11214,yes by all means
11215,34 days it is supposed to oneshot the yeast infection if it doesnt calling your doctor to get another diflucan is not a bad idea different patients need more or less diflucan depending on their physiology  chronicity of the conditions  and how they respond to the medication
11216,23 days if you truly have a yeast infection  most patients get relief 23 days after treatment is completed
11217,se doctor see your doctor so you can be re evaluated
11218,yeast infections have you ever been checked for diabetes i do not know your health profile but people with diabetes often get recurrent yeast infections you should see an obgyn physician to get some testing done
11219,could be bacteria it might not be a yeast infection you could have a bacterial infection you need a vaginal swab to make the diagnosis and then they can prescribe the right antibiotic fluconazole will not work for bacterial infections
11220,very common antibiotics are common disruptors of the normal vaginal ph balance  and can cause overpoliferation of candidal flora  resulting in yeast infections usually  otc treatments or or diflucan antifungal treatments are effective to resolve symptoms
11221,you may monistat may not have taken care of the yeast infection which are certainly common when on antibiotics try the diflucan and be sure to tell your dr for continuity of care and so they can document all your health issues in your persona medical chart
11222,yes if you have a uti then the fluconazole will not help and the infection will continue see your doctor or urgent care to get proper diagnosis and treatment
11223,might b uti or yeast the blood in the urine could be a persistent uti  ie  didnt get it cleared or the blood in the urine might be vaginally from a light cycle or infection of the vagina like with a yeast infection probably should be seen if not quickly improved with a lot of water drinking or worsening symptoms
11224,knee pain a swelling in back of your knee would most likely be a bakers cyst the best way to explore this is by getting an ultrasound of the leg
11225,knee issues lipomas may grow bigger and cause pain and difficulty with your joint movement in this case the knee and this pain could be also referred to your hip since i dont know what tests or exams were done to determine this was a lipoma another thought would be a bakers cyst which is very common you may take anti inflammatory meds for now but probably you would need to see an orthopedist surgeon
11226,see a doctor it sounds like you may have dislocated your knee cap patella this is fairly common in young females in particular you need to see an orthopedic surgeon or sports med doctor for evaluation and treatment
11227,let me help you i do believe you did popped your cap or you could popped a torn cartilage or loose body in the knee or many other things could cause that popping in any event this will cause the knee reaction and reaction of muscles around the knee and that will cause what are you talking about all the above need a doctor to take of it orthopedic surgeon good luck
11228,swollen lymphnode see you doctor if it does not go down after throat infection is treated
11229,see your doctor this is a problem that necessitates a facetoface meeting with your doctor this will allow him her to examine you  ask specific questions and possibly order tests to find out whats wrong and what to do to help you
11230,knee lump the most likely thing id a bakers cyst go see your doctor or an orthopedic surgeon for evaluation
11231,popliteal cyst is what you probably have and it may be associated with internal derangement of your knee mri is indicated hope this helps dr z
11232,get checked this type of lump should be assessed by your doctor to determine if it is a cyst  fat mass or a lymph node good luck
11233,see doctor it may be a benign cyst  but if it hurts  removing it is the answer and if it is something else they can stdy it in pathology
11234,yes that is the next step in your evaluation of your painful swollen knee good luck
11235,nursing a baby if you are or are not that matters on what to do if you are consult a lactation consultant if you are not nursing an infant  have a doctor examine your breasts this could be infection  or it could be a growth  or it could be normal breast cysts that come and go monthly in some women please have a doctor do a history and physical to attend to your problems
11236,see doctor could be a lymph node or a cyst and may or may not be related to the headaches so it is best to have it checked out
11237,acute trauma this is not to be unexpected with the nature and location of your acute injury continue to ice it for twenty minutes 34 x   d using ibuprofen or aleve can also help the injury should be healed in 1014 days if it is not or it is getting worse or loss of function see your family doctor or go to an urgent care clinic
11238,implantation bleedin hi  light cramp is common with implantation bleeding  along with short  brief spotting
11239,it can not be it happens 1014 days after the conception if there was one it should happen close to your period not every women get implantation bleeding around 33% gets one
11240,seek other causes the severe cramps may be a sign of upcoming menstrual period however  if its occurring a week earlier than normal  then other possibilities to consider is gastrointestinal issues if pain persists worsens and vaginal bleeding does not occur unlikely to be menses  prudent to seek evaluation
11241,for many women  yes hormonal changes that occur before your period cause fluid retention in breasts the stretching of tissue can cause pain and itching
11242,bleeding cervix an infection   trauma to the cervix or cancer of the cervix or hormonal problem can cause it 
11243,implantation bleed implantation bleeding is much more common on the internet than in real life it occurs rarely and exclusively in someone who is pregnant the only way to know if someone had implantation bleeding or just irregular menstrual bleeding is to wait and see if you are pregnant if your test is positive then this was implantation bleeding if it is negative then it is just irregular menstrual bleeding
11244,pt just do pregnancy test and consult with gynecologist
11245,it can be bleeding every 2 weeks can be a sign of endometrial cancer i would be wise to have a gyn md evaluate your bleeding with an appointment and possible biopsy
11246,symptoms you may be pregnant obtain a pregnancy test and find out
11247,neither are you bleeding if os  probably your period if not  it isnt period or implantation
11248,not a good choice benadryl is a short acting antihistamine zyrtec is a long acting antihistamine you may overdose if taking both at the same time or taking both in the same day consider a better allergy medication if zyrtec is not working well or if you have been taking benadryl longer than 5 days
11249,not really these are both antihistamines if both are needed then physician guidance should be sought
11250,yes it is possible however the combination might make you sedated and feel impaired significantly if you are not used to taking them together
11251,yes you can you can take both medications at the same time providing that you follow the recommended otc doses
11252,with caution please see my previous answer to this exact same question
11253,dont take together all 3 drugs mentioned are antihistamines available w o prescription benadryl diphenhydramine is most potent but also most laden w anticholinergic side effects  eg sedation  dry eyes mouth  constipation  urinary retention etc zyrtec cetirizine is more sedating than claritin loratadine both have less potential side effects than benadryl but need to find best for you dont take together
11254,yes it is ok yes it is ok as long as you are using it for short period when your allergy symptoms are not controlled with zyrtec and you are not able to sleep due to allergy symptoms
11255,yes this is safe
11256,yes this a good combination especially if you have trouble falling asleep at night
11257,yes this is safe
11258,yes this a good combination especially if you have trouble falling asleep at night
11259,yes there should not be any significant interaction although both meds are in the same class
11260,yes it is not harmful to take benadryl after zyrtec both medications are antihistamines and generally you would not need to take both of them benadryl is a stronger antihistamine and may help with symptoms unresolved by zyrtec  it often has more sedation as side effect than zyrtec
11261,should be ok while taking benadryl after zyrtec should be ok  it would be even better to know the underlying trigger to allow less medication usage an allergist could determine why symptoms are not controlled with less medication
11262,yes both can cause drowsiness saution when need to be at peak of concentration both can add to urinary steam reduction
11263,right diagnosis all of the things you list about your spine mri are common for certain age groups you mention no pain in the legs or what makes the pain worse groin pain can be more suspect for hip problems or referred pain from the pelvic organs and even the si joints if you have not seen a specialist about your issue  now is the time pt is always a good first step in managing any musculoskeletal problem
11264,repeat mri if your symptoms are new  you may need another mri disc protrusions may cause groin and hip pain with that said  physical therapy is a good start and should be tried before jumping back in the magnet note: if pain is severe or you are having sensory symptoms or weakness  an mri is indicated
11265,see back surgeon this may or may not be the source of your discomfort you need a good history and physical to see if the findings correlate
11266,noninvasive treament though the radiology report may read annular tear  as a spine surgeon who has often correlated what was read as an annular tear on an mri report with visual inspection of the annulus in surgery  what is considered an annular tear by a radiologist equates to nothing of structural or clinical significance these mri descriptors do not represent clinically significant pain generators
11267,about 20% of people with lumbar spinal stenosis will have coexisting cervical spinal stenosis spinal stenosis is a narrowing of a bony canal structure such as the central spine canal or the exiting nerve holes known as neuroforamen which when severe enough by imaging studies will be deemed spinal stenosis
11268,it it sounds like you have a similar process occurring in both your lumbar and cervical spine spinal thecal sac and foraminal stenosis narrowing can produce inflammation in the nerves this could lead to pain in the neck  shoulder or arm many people have such narrowing and do not have symptoms however some people will have significant symptoms which would also include numbness  weakness and tingling you surgeon will evaluate you and try to determine if your symptoms are related to your mri findings
11269,evaluation may be it is time to be evaluated by neurosurgeon
11270,l5 s1 back pain with sciatic type unilateral leg pain localizes your pain generator to that level back pain alone as a symptom is more difficult i treat these problems with physical therapy and rest an epidural steroid may help diagnostic studies may include a provocative discogram if all fails surgical management for back pain alone is controversial but may include an alif procedure
11271,posture  shots low back problems pain results in favoring one side or the other  and change in posture can lead to change in contour of back steroid shots can result in loss of fatty tissue  ending in sunken place best to check with your back doctor
11272,probably not an mri of the lumbar spine is usually narrowly focused on the spine your doctor may suspect there is a pinched nerve in your spine that is causing your pain a dedicated mri of the pelvis and or hip would be necessary to directly evaluate those structures docs may order combined mri lumbar spine and pelvis  but this is significant additional cost may be good to start with just one
11273,see a pain doctor fortunately  most cases of lower back pain do get better with a appropriate treatment plan i would advise you to consult with your primary care doctor first to see if you need to see a spine surgeon or a pain specialist
11274,two reasons for pain are included in your description the disc bulge at l23 could compress nerves in the central canal or in the small neural foramina where the nerves exit retrolisthesis is when a vertebral body moves backwards with relation to the bone below it this can also pinch the nerves in the central canal or neural foramina you could see a spine surgeon  or go nonsurgical with physical therapy
11275,no to assess lungs for masses  cancerous or not  need cat scan thorax chest xray will consistently miss small potentially curable tumors depending on location in lungs   size and densitymri of the spine has a limited view of parts of the lungs and you can not rule out the presence of a lung lesion with an mri of the spine and a chest xray mri of the thoracic spine is not used to find lung nodules
11276,probably most lung cancers show up on chest xray unless they are really small in which case a ct scan is better mri does not picture the lungs very well at any rate  lung cancer is almost never painful unless it has spread to bones or other structures and if you smoke  it is always a good idea to quit
11277,get it reevaluated this needs reevaluate and probably a new mri see your orthopedist another tear is certainly possible
11278,chest mri would probably be unlikely to add anything
11279,more info needed where is the pain exactly assuming the tspine mris and ct were normal not uncommonly  problems in the mid to lower cervical spine can manifest as pain in the upper back  in and around the shoulder blades mri cervical spine can be considered if this is the case a musculoskeletal ultrasound performed by an experienced doctor may provide the answer chest mri unlikely to add benefit
11280,luvox luvox fluvoxamine is approved by the fda for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder however  it has been used offlabel by some to treat major depressive disorder  ptsd  panic disorder and social anxiety disorder
11281,luvox can work for some cases of depression  but is mostly indicated for obsessive compulsive disorder
11282,yes it is
11283,yes it is zoloft is used for treatment of depression  ocd  ptsd and sad zoloft is a great ssri medication with some side effects check with your physician for risks and rewards
11284,yes with close monitoring by your psychiatrist  mirtazepine can be a safe and effective addition to fluvoxamine in treating major depression where needed  mirtazepine can help normalize sleep and also reduce anxiety
11285,both drugs used with major depression many side effects see your physician before mixing these two good psycho pharmacologist would help not self help drugs must be used with physician advise only
11286,exercise the best nonprescription treatment for depression and anxiety is exercise and a healthy diet with a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables exercise alone can raise the chemicals in the brain that help ward off depression that is far better than a supplement you also just plain feel a tad better after exercise because you are doing what you can do to help treat and control symptoms go walk
11287,individual luvox was evaluated for treating ocd  but any of the ssri medications  as well as some tricyclic medications help with ocd best to combine medication with treatment to get best results some mindfulness approaches have been helpfulsee your physician for assistance
11288,medications and therapy combined work better than either alone  including ocd while determining a course of action regarding your medication  asking your provider for a referral to a therapist who is qualified to treat your illness  and to augment this strategy might be helpful regarding ssri’s it can be quite individual as far as response using two treatments may serve as a preventative measure  also
11289,side effects im not sure why you would want to take luvox unless you need it i would suggest not doing it you would be vulnerable to the side effects without any benefit to gain nausea  diarrhea  sedation  dizziness  etc could all happen  but why do this 
11290,luvox if you can tolerate luvox  it might be better option for ocd review with your doctor also  for the ocd  talk to a therapist about cognitive behavior therapy to boost response to medications
11291,yes wellbutrin can raise your blood pressure in doses above 300mg if you have an eating disorder or alcoholism it can lower your threshold to have a seizure otherwise the combo is safe relatively
11292,try nonmed approach talking therapy ranks really high cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy can be effective aim for daily exercise  8 hours of sleep per night  good nutrition w 5 servings of veggies  4 of fruit per day try tai chi  yoga  qi gong  progressive muscle relaxation  deep breathing exercises  meditation dont isolate  spend time w friends  stay active
11293,depression medicines antidepressants can certainly be used for depression  but are also effective in various anxiety disorders aggressiveness is another possible use in some people  and so is ptsd symptoms i dont know why this was prescribed for your boyfriend  but he would know the symptoms he originally had
11294,its working hes not depressed because the antidepressants are working or  maybe hes taking it for pain or headaches
11295,yes sounds very much like influenza or a similar viral illness
11296,theyre same thing either way  influenza virus  or rsv or other common autumnal virus  its a viral illness usually flu has a high fever associated with it other viruses may or may not if you are in contact with immunocompromised people  see your doctor for a flu test if its positive  influenza can be treated to prevent contagion
11297,thick phlegm if you cough up purulent mucous  it could be bronchitis or pneumonia   the lost of voice is from laryngitis you may have the flu see your primary care doctor for diagnosis and treatment
11298,see doctor you have mixed symptoms of uri with gi disorder if you are describing correctly  i am worried about vomiting bile please see your doctor
11299,its possiblesee dr the tonsil stone is probably food debris that got stuck in one of the crevices in the tonsil  but if you have a sore throat with or without white spots  you need to see the dr it could be strep  a virus  or something else if you have been having oral sex  stds need to be checked for as well
11300,chrin tonsillitis depends on the time course of events is this recent or long term problem it sounds like a chronic low grade problem with tonsil stones and bacterial overgrowth in the tonsils it doesnt sound like an std
11301,we we usually start to worry when an adult has a temperature over 102 in fact  a hospitalized patient with a temperature over 1015 usually gets blood cultures to look for a bacterial infection 1038 is high enough to warrant a workup  so  yes  i think it would be a good idea to see a doctor
11302,call your doctor with symptoms this complex  you owe it to yourself to call your doctor to help you make sense out of them
11303,symptoms typically  flu symptoms include fever  headache  nasal congestion  sore throat  cough  body aches  fatigue  etc with no other symptoms except a cough  it is unlikely you have the flu possibilities for a cough include acute bronchitis  bronchospasm from any cause allergy  asthma  etc  postnasal drip  gerd  etc if the cough persists or other symptoms develop  see your doctor
11304,upper repinfection you probabely have a viral upper respiratory infection  which may be flu you need to check with your doctor if you need any meds etc
11305,typical influenza although flu influenza can cause nasal congestion and sneezing  often it does not your symptoms are very typical  especially if you have fever and also develop a cough however  you shouldnt assume the diagnosis  and flu season is over so see your doctor  if s he believes influenza is likely  treatment with an antiviral drug like oseltamivir tamflu may speed recovery good luck
11306,typical influenza although flu influenza can cause nasal congestion and sneezing  often it does not your symptoms are very typical  especially if you have fever and also develop a cough however  you shouldnt assume the diagnosis  and flu season is over so see your doctor  if s he believes influenza is likely  treatment with an antiviral drug like oseltamivir tamflu may speed recovery good luck
11307,see a doctor if you have fever and are coughing up mucous and blood you should go and be seen immediately  to an er if necessary if this is related to strep throat you have the potential to have a lifethreatening condition please go now and i hope this turns out to be only a minor issue  but do not gamble good luck
11308,most probably you got strep infection from your daughter
11309,its possible strep throat can be contagious  particularly during the few days before a persons symptoms start and even within the first 24 hours of antibiotic use you should review this problem with your primary care physician best of luck
11310,yes you could be pregnant and the test has not had sufficient time in which to become positive but many other things could be responsible for your symptoms if they keep up and you are retested negatively  go see an ob gyn
11311,yes but many other things may be going on
11312,possibly try waiting 1 week then repeating the test if its negative  see your doctor
11313,unlikely modern home pregnancy tests are pretty accurate and since you are on birth control also  this makes it pretty darn unlikely for you to be pregnant retest i a week if your symptoms continue
11314,if if you have had 5 negative pregnancy tests  including 1 negative blood test then the hormones that detect pregnancy are not present the pregnancy hormone is detectable in the blood 11 days after conception they are released by cells in the placenta which forms to nourish a fetus since these hormones are not detectable  then you are probably not pregnant white vaginal discharge is not typically a sign of pregnancy hormonal changes and premenstrual symptoms can cause soreness of the breast  bloating  heachaches and mood changes
11315,you tested too soon you tested before missing a period that means the tests were not valid now that you have missed your period is time to get an accurate and valid answer test again
11316,its possible take another test you could have conceived too recently for the tests to show up pregnancy test are accurate about two weeks after conception if it has been at least that long since your last unprotected sex  and you still dont get your period or a positive test  then check with your doctor for other reasons for a late period
11317,possibly please check a pregnancy test
11318,it depends the earliest way to tell if you are pregnant is with an early detection pregnant test done on your first voided urine in the morning this can be positive even a few days before a missed period your doctors exam should be able to tell if it has been more than 4 weeks since ovulation
11319,trust the test home pregnancy tests are very accurate they are the same tests used in a doctors office they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period if you doubt the result you can repeat it in 12 days if you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection sounds like just a late period
11320,possibly pregnancy is a posibility purchase and perform a home pregnancy test it should turn positive by the time yore a week late if its negative  repeat it in 1 week
11321,wait to repeat test wait one week and repeat the pregnancy test
11322,question unclear sorry not sure of question  your mother should keep in touch with her treatment team have regular follow up
11323,unsure what you mean
11324,not a specific sign but any change in bowel habits is a warning sign have your doctor check your stool for occult blood if that is positive  you need to have a colonoscopy
11325,slight advantage cerazette has only progestogen with out estrogen as in common combined birth control pill   less clotting problems   could be used during breast feeding   still has very slight risk of breast cancer   if this is the issue   why dont you adapt non medication b c like iud  speak to your doctor
11326,difficult to say return to consciousness is difficult to predict and is based upon the size and extent of the tumor as well as the extent of surgery and any complications or swelling your surgeon is probably in a better place to judge this and to be able to see signs that things are improving
11327,it varies depending it depends on the stage of disease and extent of prior treatment when the tumor is untreated with any prior chemotherapy  then we have fairly good results and patients typically live an average of 9 to 12 months and there are some long term survivors if patient has a good response to chemotherapy however it is a very bad disease once it has failed chemotherapy  pts living only for 2 to 3 month
11328,probably not call her doctor that did the surgery and discuss this with him her
11329,unuasual case this is quite unusual situation was it read blood what was the amount if it is bright read and significant amount go back to see the surgeon what a young age to start with abdominal surgeries i wander what was the indication for surgery: gb and by the way took the appendix too  i doubt that going after an inflamed appendix and than take the gb would not be a wise decision my opinion
11330,doctor if shes passing frank blood in the stool then she needs to see a doctor  and really should do so fairly quickly she will almost certainly need a colonoscopy  based on her symptoms as well as her family history good luck
11331,see doctor now with those symptoms and that family history she should be seen right away will likely need colonoscopy
11332,not likely anal leakage and itching are not common signs of colon cancer  especially for someone your age however  these are uncomfortable and concerning symptoms and should be checked out by a doctor
11333,hemorrhoids much more likely that you have hemorrhoids rather than colon cancer at age 22 is extremely unlikely if it does not resolve with some fiber  which will bulk up the stools and keep them soft  then see your doctor
11334,colon cancer there are so many other reasons on a young 34 year old female that i would consider before thinking of cancer anxiety  ibs  gyn related issue  infective  malabsorption  gastritis too many to list i would recommend follow up with a family or internist
11335,she needs to be seen the symptoms you have described suggest a possible infection that may be developing increased swelling and increasing pain suggests that you should call her doctor and have her seen as soon as possible using advil and tylenol will only mask the symptoms and delay diagnosis
11336,breast fed baby your babys  constipation may not be related to the rice cereal at all breast fed babies can go a whole week without having a stool and are not considered constipated
11337,stop the rice stop adding rice cereal to the pumped milk good job on breast feeding  by the way keep breast feeding and keep the zantac rice cereal is very constipating for reflux elevate the head of the crib in addition to constipation  rice cereal before age 6 months is related to obesity in later life you may also try a glycerine suppository found in the baby section after 7 days call md
11338,most likely  yes it is not unusual for babies to not pass a stool for 2448 hours and then have a normal stool if the infrequent stooling continues or the consistency of the stool changes  contact your pediatrician
11339,normal breast fed babies can have bowel movement from 68 times day to once every 47 days both normal if ur child is not uncomfortable  dont worry formula may be changed to whey protein based  eg good start whey protein increases stool bulk  so s he will poo more often again  if the baby is not uncomfortable  not to worry  no change needed talk to babys doc reg starting solid food
11340,may be ibs inflammation  infection  ibs may be associated w  abdominal discomfort  altered  alternating stool pattern  accompanying nausea  bloating  gasiness often improved by stooling  ibs is defined by changes in perception of gut distension  motility  sensation diet  emotional stress play significant roles here in patients with ibs  but first need to rule out inflammation  ischemia   infection
11341,see a md vaginal yeast infections may spread to the skin of the perirectal space   but almost never produces constipation see a md for an accurate assessment
11342,baby satisfied sounds like maybe the baby has latch issues on the breast and may not be getting as much to eat on the breast as when you gave the bottle baby may have some weak suck muscles that make breast feeding harder is there a lactation consultant in your area> that would help so much you may also benefit form an oral motor evaluation good question
11343,it can not be it happens 1014 days after the conception if there was one it should happen close to your period not every women get implantation bleeding around 33% gets one
11344,any cow milk product cows milk is present in most cheeses  yoghurt  cream  butter and hence virtually all dairy you must read the labels to know for sure soy based formulas are the most common alternatives your pediatrician should help you select a formula that is milkfree it may be possible later in childhood to introduce sheep and goat milk products but wait for your pediatrician to give the ok
11345,constipation constipation is the passage of a dry  hard stool  not necessarily the absence of daily stool if you suspect your child may be crying because he is ill  call your childs doctor that being said  constipation is common in infants and there are a couple things you can do to help 1 give pear or prune juice  1oz age in months day so in your case 2 oz not only does prune or pear juice have sugar which can help soften bms  but also has fiber notice the gritty texture when you drink it this does not mean that you should be feeding your baby juice as a part of his regular diet  but its ok in daily small amounts to treat constipation 2 if juice does not work  then you can try a glycerine suppository which you can buy over the counter just cut a peasized piece of the glycerine and place it in the babys anus to lubricate the hard stool this is not meant for daily use  so if you find that your baby needs a suppository in order to have a bm despite dietary changes  discuss with your childs doctor 3 do not use mineral oil  laxatives or enemas these methods are not safe for infants 4 finally  if constipation is persistent and not improved with any of the above recommendations  be sure to contact your babys doctor there are some very rare underlying disorders such as hirschprungs disease  cystic fibrosis or hypothyroidism that can cause chronic constipation
11346,while true most babies around two months old are starting to achieve intestinal colonizing of normal floral bacteria our stool is mostly made of bacteria than any other component when we excrete it naturally this will cause the stool to firm and therefore lower the frequency of the child stooling per day or per week constipation should be addressed if the infant is in discomfort or exam in abnormal
11347,see your doctor you may have a mastitis breast infection especially if breastfeeding also possible a yeastinfection of the nipple you should see your doctor for a breastexam and possibly topical ointment or antibiotics  especially if you develop a fever
11348,you you may benefit from topical corticosteroids alone or in combination with nonsteroidal topical antiinflammatory medications  such as pimecrolimus or tacrolimus using an effective moisturizer several times a day will be helpful too
11349,see dermatologist you may have both allergic contact and irritant dermatitis talk to a dermatologist or allergist to see what can be done as long as you are in contact with the contact allergen   no treatment will work on rare occasions  one may even become allergic to the cortisone used to treat the rash
11350,photo needed without a photo of the rash it would be impossble to diagnose were you wearing gloves or working with chemicals could be related to your mediciations consult with your physician
11351,eczema it sound like eczema try a moisturizer like cerave cream twice a day as well as hydrocortisone cream until you can see a dermatologist to get a prescription strength topical steroid
11352,many possibilities from your description it is not possible to come up with a single answer it is best that you consider being seen by a dermatologist to help  clarify the problem and possible treatments
11353,see your doctor your doctor needs to examine these in person to he she can see them live
11354,a fungal infection a fungal skin infection often present with ringshaped lesion with serpentine borders and mild  flaky scales can be red irritated under skin folds such as underarms otc lamisil lotrimin tinactin all seem to work fine for simple ringworm on body  not scalp bearded areas if not better in couple of weeks  or worsens  consult doc for possible alternate diagnosis and proper treatment good luck
11355,contact dermatitis sounds like the rash from exposure to poison ivy resin i recommend that you see a dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment
11356,medical evaluation dear cheetah  this is one of those things that actually requires a medical history  examination of the lesions in order to provide an even remotely accure assessment suggest this be evaluated by your personal physician or a dermatologist take care
11357,it it sounds like you are dealing with a streptococcal pharyngitis strep throat you will need to see your doctor for a rapid strep test  exam  and treatment if it is strep then you will need antibiotics for at least 7 days im the meantime you can take ibuprofen for pain and gargle with warm salt water please seek medical care right away
11358,salt water sounds like you have mild inflammation of normal structures in the mouth and throat any fever present anything lasting more than 710 days needs to be checked by a professional health care provider in the mean time try gargling with a 1 2 tsp of salt in a cup of warm water for 5 minutes  several times in a day
11359,allergic reaction  best to see your otolaryngologist for exact diagnosis and appropriate treatment
11360,see following could be allergic reaction to something  i would recommend seeing your doctor  also look for any new product  that you might have used
11361,folliculitis if you recently shaved the areas this could be caused by inflammation around the hair follicles called folliculitis you can try using over the counter acne washes to help with your condition  but if it persists it is important to have it evaluated by your physician or dermatologist new rashes which are spreading should be seen as soon as possible
11362,bug bite most such localized spots would be the result of some bug deciding to bit you  you body deciding it didnt appreciate the attention
11363,see your doctor most likely a yeast infection  but could be herpes it needs to be examined and cultured swab for herpes and koh prep for yeast yeast can be easily treated  but can be a symptom of other problems  like diabetes
11364,could be psoriasis this could be psoriasis or a superficial skin cancer get that thing checked out asap
11365,rash rashes are hard to diagnose sometimes when you are looking at them impossible to diagnose without even seeing them you need to see your doctor
11366,unlikely herpes usually affects a small patch of skin  not a large area like your entire abdomen there is usually a raised reddish area with a cluster of tiny fluidfilled blisters they may itch  but usually there is tenderness over the skin even before the bumps appear and there is more pain or irritation than itching the bumps open up and become tiny scabs as they heal see a derm if it persists
11367,unlikely local red itchy bumps are not typical of a herpes infection depending on subtle things such as distribution  presence of fluid filled pockets  and clinical course  it can also be shingles  contact dermatitis  folliculitis  or other skin problem the best thing to do  is to have a healthcare provider look at it
11368,rash spreading you need to see a doctor asap since this could be the spread of an infection or a contagious rash
11369,rash rashes are hard to diagnose sometimes when you are looking at them impossible to diagnose without even seeing them you need to see your doctor
11370,allergy you are describing urticaria bumps on your extremities the cough and sniffle may also be on an allergic basis the other possibility may be a viral infection i strongly recommend you consult your primary care doctor and rule out an allergic reaction to possibly a food
11371,contact dermatitis probably contact dermatitis
11372,could be the poop fecal matter from breast milk congratulations you are feeding correctly is usually much looser at the beginning of breast feeding you must remember whatever you eat comes through in the breast milk the stool will harden up eventually so go ahead and to continue the breast feeding and enjoy your baby
11373,what did your pediat pediatrician say  there are many different types and sometimes you have to try a few before u find the right one  but you should be using what your babys doc recommends
11374,90 percent breast dont decrease the breast milk intake yet some babies will start decreasing their breast milk intake gradually over the next few months but the breast milk is still a really good food dont wean yet unless you have to for some reason
11375,varies usually when babies start eating solids  the amount of milk they ingest decreases  let your baby lead the way you may want to nurse him sometimes after solid feeds  if he eats 3 solid meals a day he will still be nursing every couple of hours
11376,alcohol in breast alcohol is metabolized at the rate of 1 oz hr use that as a guide to figure out how far from breast feeding you could drink
11377,continue breastfeed please continue breastfeeding when you breastfeed  you give your baby some of the antibodies infection fighters that your body has developed to fight off your sore throat flu in other words  breastfeeding will not make your baby sick to prevent spreading infection: handwashing hand sanitizer after nose blowing  kiss the back of babys head  not mouth or hand  cough in your sleeve
11378,none there is none  other than personal discomfort
11379,stool the mucussy stools may be fue to the transition from breast milk to formula
11380,do you have ovaries 1 blockage of a milk duct  we make milk every day no matter what  even past menopause almost all milk is resorbed in drainage tubes=ducts except when breast feeding blockage from dried milk  small infection  or inflammation can cause severe pain as the milk is being pushed against the blockage 2 fat necrosis  a tiny blood clot that kills a piece of fat not dangerous 3 infection
11381,fibrocystic change you may have a cyst in that breast or the beginning of one better get it checked
11382,normal poop that is wonderful  perfectly functioning newborn baby poop dont change a thing and dont worry about a thing he does not have diarrhea  that is what infant poop is at its best color can be yellows  greens  browns  oranges these are all ok colors and yes  it is very runny and explosive  stand clear of butt when changing diaper congratulations
11383,likely normal poop if he is eating well  gaining weight  and looking good otherwise this is probably all normal for your little man
11384,no problem no problems good for lactating women
11385,yes yes you may use
11386,allergic possible reaction to the spray i would avoid further use  and see your family doc if it doesnt improve
11387,antibiotic ointment you may be developing impetigo use antibiotic ointment
11388,time to see dr ok  home remedies did not work  so you need to see your dr   urgent care   etc to get it examined and treatment
11389,hard to say the yeast infection may have caused some itching burning  irritation of the vagina without an exam it is impossible to say for sure  but a vaginal vulvar rash is ery common with yeast infections
11390,probably eczema  but could be eczema  but there are many things this could be persistent or enlarging nipple lesions need to be evaluated by your doc for paget disease of breast
11391,contact dermatitis without seeing your rash  yore at the mercy of guess it sounds some sort of allergic dermatitis like contact one if able to identify the offending agent  make sure to do your best to avoid further contact with it otherwise  try benadryl at night  avoid hot water  scrubbing your body with a sponge or scrub and drying soaps  which will make it worse if the rash is worse  see doc
11392,rashes are tough rashes are tough to diagnose without actually seeing them however  if by circular rash you mean a circleshaped rash with rash only on the edge and clear in the middle  this could be ringworm  which is a fungal infection in the skin not a worm the bumps on your rump could also be a fungal rash advise that you see your doctor for an examination to determine the cause of the rash and treat
11393,itchy bumps folliculitis is a bacterial or fungal infection of the pores and can be one cause of itchy bumps itchy round rashes can be allergy to a contactant or a ringworm fungus or a yeast rash like tinea versicolor  or a patch of nummular eczema  or other conditions you need to see a dermatologist to examine your skin and determine if they are the same rash or two different problems
11394,send us a picture you can upload a picture of the rash at www imgurcom the picture will be tagged with its own url website you can resubmit the question to us again with the url address listed and we will be able to view it this is all done anonymously
11395,see your doctor you may be suffering from something more than skin deep see a doctor asap
11396,see your doctor you may be suffering from something more than skin deep see a doctor asap
11397,eczema nobody presents exactly as the textbook says medicine is more detective work than not  so i would follow the recommendations of the doctor add an oral antihistamine if this was not recommended in addition to the topical therapy
11398,chemical burn chemical burns should be treated initially with rinsing  but now with steroid creams see an md for a topical steroid rx
11399,call obgyn an anti fungal like monostat will probably be prescribed
11400,very common antibiotics are common disruptors of the normal vaginal ph balance  and can cause overpoliferation of candidal flora  resulting in yeast infections usually  otc treatments or or diflucan antifungal treatments are effective to resolve symptoms
11401,please see please see your gynecologist for evaluation and to discuss treatment options this could be many diseases
11402,rare rare rare one single pill will most likely cause no liver trouble diflucan is a very effective treatment for vaginal yeast infection for 2 reasons not only does it take care of the vaginal yeast overgrowth which causes terrible itching it also kills off bowel yeast which may feed into future yeast infections it is a very safe medication  and works very well for yeast infection
11403,very uncommon the possibility of liver irritation is more for those who are on this medication chronically it is safe to take to get rid of your yeast infection
11404,could be some women are more prone to yeast infections while taking antibiotics the itching can be intense and you may notice a cottage cheese type of discharge from the vagina try an over the counter treatment and if it does not improve  call your physician who can further evaluate you and prescribe diflucan if needed in the future  if you need antibiotics take acidophilus which can lessen the ris
11405,could be probably not related to the dept see your doctor and get checked
11406,are you diabetic see your doctor to check for problems that can predispose to yeast infectionse g  immune problems  diabetes  heavy or repeated use of broad spectrum antibiotics your doctor can run screening lab tests to check on why you have chronic yeast infections
11407,yeast most likely a yeast infection  even if you have no discharge  but there are other possible causes  so see your doctor for an exam  cultures if needed and make sure your bf gets treated as well otherwise he will just pass it back to you after you get rid of it
11408,possibly you need to get a vaginal culture for std and a urine culture to see if you have a bladder infection
11409,discharge most likly is yeast infection fallowing antibiotics use monistat vaginal cream over the counter and probiotic capsules orally
11410,see an ob gyn see an ob gyn
11411,repeat test i would do another pregnancy test in a few days or even have a blood pregnancy test done just to be sure if you are not pregnant  then sometimes women do skip a cycle or two our bodies are not machines and we can have an occaional off month
11412,miscarriage could be missed miscarriage could also be a ovarian cyst or hormone imbalance home preg test are good but not 100% i would get a blood test and ultrasound to see whats going on could also be meds  stress or a mass in ovary or uterus
11413,anovulation if you didnt ovulate on time or didnt ovulate at all this month  the hormone your body produces can cause all those symptoms it doesnt mean you cant get pregnant this cycle either so you should repeat the test if your cycle doesnt come if it lasts for a while  you should talk to your doctor to find out the cause
11414,possible but not likely your breasts are probably sore because you are about to start your period however  home pregnancy tests are not 100% accurate if you still havent started your period in the next couple days  so another test
11415,very small chance by the time the period is late  home urine pregnancy tests are very reliable but if a woman has been drinking alot of water or other fluids  the pregnancy hormone beta=hcg might be diluted enough in the urine to cause a false negative repeat the test first thing in the morning before drinking fluids
11416,occassionally depending on what type of cyst it could cause those symptoms but rarely will it cause breast pain and late menses please be evaluated by your doctor
11417,yes test again in another week
11418,yes you could definitely be pregnant  especially since you have not had a menstrual period in a while you should perform a urine pregnancy test if it is negative  you are not pregnant you might consider making a doctors appointment as soon as possible if you do not get your period there are also other causes of missed late periods that your doctor would be able to evaluate
11419,repeat test repeat the home test if it is still negative after 6 days then you are not pregnant and the cycle is just late since the bhcg pregnancy hormone doubles every 48 hrs it would be positive by now if you were pregnant
11420,repeat test repeat the pregnancy test if you were pregnant it would be positive by now if it is negative still then you are not pregnant
11421,pregnant its a low chance if the blood test came back negative if you are having signs of pregnancy  repeat the test in 12 weeks if you are pregnant  the number should increase
11422,lotsir irritable bowel  celiac  pancreatitis  gallstones  inflammatory bowel
11423,see a gi doctor you need to be thoroughly evaluated and may require an endoscopic exam best to start out with an expert in this area rather than be evaluated and then reevaluated good luck
11424,not twisted stomach indigestion or irritable bowels can cause such symptoms  common  watch your diet  increase intake of fruits and vegetables  avoid sweets and caffeine and dairy as much as you can   walk often  see your doctor if you still suffer
11425,for a few months these symptoms should not last for a few months the type and severity of symptoms of the nature you describe suggest something that needs to be more thoroughly evaluated and workedup by your family doc or a gastroenterologist make an appointment sooner than later
11426,sounds like lousy diet try to resist the temptation to eat junk foods and stick to natural foods
11427,could be a person with celiac who is eating gluten daily could definitely have those symptoms every day
11428,daily they would be very uncomfortable
11429,most likely ibs irritable bowel syndrome  talk with your pcp or gi
11430,yes and no blood clots are not uncommon during menstrual flow if you flow is heavier then usual diarrhea should not occur with your menstrual flow occasionally a condition called endometriosis can involve your bowel and give symptoms of diarrhea or constipation during your menstrual flow seek help from your gyn to establish if you have that diagnosis or if you just happened to get a gi infection
11431,lactose intolerance if not  irritable bowel see a gastroenterologist
11432,sick after laxative depending on which type you might have some bloating and if it worked too well some diarrhea some of the laxatives have fiber and other ingredients that can cause fermentation while waiting to move thru this will cause bloating other laxatives cause a movement of water into the gut causing discomfort and bloating and nausea it is a little unusual at 20 to have serious constipation
11433,possibly yes mri can show soft tissue injury ligaments tendons it would be helpful to know if your mri mentioned injury to tendons or ligaments most of the time they will show sprains of ligaments or tendons which are micro tears in the fibers or ligaments or tendons with the symptoms you are having it is very possible you may have a sprain you should follow up with your doctor if you are not better
11434,no mri should have revealed if there were any torn ligaments or tendons were seen follow up with the physician who ordered the mri
11435,depends on symptoms its very import for your doctor to correlate what radiologists find on your scans with your physical findings and symptoms as far as your sinus findings  these are normally air filled areas along your face but an mri will show if the lining is thickened or if the space has become fluid filled feel free to schedule a consult and upload your images and we can review these findings in detail
11436,yes there are two main causes for pain on the medial side if the knee  1 meniscus tear  2 arthritis if the mri showed protrusion or extrusion  then yesa meniscus tear is possible if your ortho surgeon told you to live with it then it wouldnt hurt to get a 2nd opinion
11437,pain possible old fractures can result in pain as can ddd  arthritis
11438,stem cells check out regenexxcom to see if they might be of help to you
11439,the foramen is the opening through which a nerve root exits the spinal canal when it is narrowed  usually by degenerative arthritis and or a disc herniation  it can pinch or squeeze the nerve root going through it  possibly causing symptoms in your case it would be the right l4 nerve root the dural sac is the membrane surrounding the spinal cord
11440,toes that dont mov it sounds to me like you have a radiculopathy affecting lumbar roots four and five sacral one two you need an mri of your lumbosacral spine
11441,many possibilities could be venous insufficienct which is a back up in the veins that causes pooling of blood in leg
11442,see ortho continue to see ortho  especially an orhto who specializes in knees if you are overweight  it is crucial you lose weight tkr in a 33yo is rare as surgery is always the last option not sure if you have tried synvisc hyalan gf  which may help your condition keep seeing the ortho and working on the best treatment good luck
11443,knee pain the knee can be caused by arthritis  ligament injury  tendon tears  muscle strain   with your conditions  you might benefit from steroid injection and or synvisc injection before knee replacement please see a pain management doctor or orthopedic surgeon for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment
11444,eventually yes  a knee replacement is almost certainly in your future however  55 is on the young side for this surgery knee sleeves  nsaids and injections such as synvisc or orthovisc may help and should be tried first
11445,stop worrying mines the size of a large lima bean and ive had it since second year of med school if its staying the same size and isnt obviously fixed to important stuff  just forget about it yod be amazed how many people have these  a majority of folks have a small peasizer or two
11446,symptoms symptoms  such as fever  local pain  generalized weakness will help in understanding if there is still deep seated infection followup with white blood cell counts and inflammatory tests: esr or crp will help as well if there is clinical concern
11447,good questio if a radiograph does not visualize either infection or tooth fragment  energy testing will identify and quantify the presence of infection appropriate detoxification and or surgery will resolve the infection and swelling
11448,ctscan we have not seen you clinically this is a question you need to ask your doctor
11449,cannot diagnose without an exam and the ability to see these lesions cannot tell what they are if lymph nodes  they are probably doing what they are supposed to  cleaning up inflammation see your local pcp if these continue or get larger
11450,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs carries things too big to go into the arteries veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria viruses cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
11451,doubt cancer mild lymphadenopathy is very common with cold symptoms and can even be allergy mediated at this time of the fall allergy season  it may take weeks for the swelling to go down the more you feel the node and palpate it  the longer it will stay enlarged and the more likely it will get irritated try rest  fluids  and ask your dr for an inhaled corticosteroid nasal spray to help with the pnd
11452,reactive node if the lymph node is easy to move around and is not getting bigger it is likely reactive meaning your body is mounting an immune response to fight off infection
11453,neck node you have seen 3 different doctors for the enlarged lymph node and despite being told by these medical professionals that it is just a normally reactive node to some sinus inflammation  you are concerned about cancer at 18 i suspect you have anxiety disorder that may not be properly dealt with ask for treatment of your sinusitis or allergic rhinitis and see if it resolves unlikely neoplastic
11454,no cancer if it was cancer and not treated it grow fast
11455,68mm lymph nodes are not really enlarged if they are morphologically normal  and have been stable for four years  it is probably nothing to worry about
11456,give it time your lymph nodes do an as needed job in your body they work to clean up the debris created by infections and return the cleaned up body fluid to the circulationyou have a known cause and the nodes are shrinking most reactive nodes will gradually swell while working and shrink back to base size over a 34 week period
11457,follow up uaually when you complete your medication for a recheck to make sure the strep has cleared and you are better all the best
11458,not to worry one can never rule out cancer unless the lymph node is biopsied however a lymph node that is painless and not enlarging is most likely a reactive lymph node or calcified lymph node as a result of a prior infection in the area if the lymph node enlarges or becomes painful i would advise you to have it examined by a physician
11459,up to you it us up to you  but you could also get a second clinical opinion before you go for a biopsy
11460,depends on imaging the nodes characteristics matter most  and that can only be determined by reviewing the actual images a neck ct can be submitted to http:  conciergeradiologistcom in the next few weeks for an assessment that would better be able to answer your question
11461,could be serious enlarged lymph nodes can indicate infection from virus or bacteria  or something more serious like lymphoma or other cancers new enlarged lymph nodes for over a month is concerning  and warrants physician evaluation
11462,infection your symptoms suggest vaginal infection or inflammation recommend you see gyn medical provider for evaluation hope this was helpful best of luck dr r
11463,vaginal infection i am presuming you dont think you could be pregnant obviously the first thing to do with a missed period is check a pregnancy test  even if you are irregular if no pregnancy and this type of discharge  next thing to do is check for infection: bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas are two possibilities see your doctor for diagnostic tests good wishes:
11464,brown = old blood irregular periods are one of the most common problems obgyns treat if this is one time problem it usually resolves on its own if this is a recurring problem you should be evaluated infections  hormonal changes can cause spotting if there is a concern for pregnancy then do a home pregnancy test  there are many options available to help regulate the menstrual cycle schedule a visit
11465,do a pregnancy test and get your answer
11466,can be not all pregnancies begin with an implantation bleed but implantation bleeding is not at all abnormal and can be just spotting or can even be mistaken for a menstrual period hope this helps
11467,need more info this is a sign of several problems from infection or hormonal imbalance or ovarian problem you should consult with your ob gyn to find out the source of your complaint
11468,check a preg test if you are 1345 years old this is probably not an issue but needs to be followed by your gyn
11469,yes often a womans secretions will increase around the time of ovulation this can be associated with spotting and cramps for 12 days
11470,take a test home pregnancy tests are very accurate they are the same tests used in a doctors office they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period if you doubt the result you can repeat it in 12 days if you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection
11471,vaginal infection esp candida is a possibility follow up with ur gyn take care http:  wwwmwebmdcom women guide sexualhealthvaginalinfections
11472,still still meaning you tested positive sounds like you are starting to get your period
11473,maybe it can take several days to a week to have your first period i recommend waiting until after your next period a month from now before trying to get pregnant that gives time for the lining of the uterus to become normal good luck
11474,no while it may mean nothing serious is wrong  and will go away  we cannot tell from here other more serious problems may be the cause call your doc or get seen today if you have dizziness  severe pain  or fever  heavy bleeding  more than a pad soaked in an hour  go to an er if you cannot reach your doc
11475,monitor your cycles discharge is not a sign of pregnancy hoever if you miss a cycle  do a home pregnancy test
11476,implantation bleed implantation bleeding is much more common on the internet than in real life it occurs rarely and exclusively in someone who is pregnant the only way to know if someone had implantation bleeding or just irregular menstrual bleeding is to wait and see if you are pregnant if your test is positive then this was implantation bleeding if it is negative then it is just irregular menstrual bleeding
11477,see your doctor having these types of symptoms can best be solved by having your doctor perform a thorough evaluation only through this type of process can he she discover whats going on and how best to help you
11478,dysfunctional bleed we call this dysfunctional uterine bleeding any chance of pregnancy if so  recommend home pregnancy test on first morning urine if neg  repeat in 710 days if both neg unlikely you are pregnant and this is a miscarriage if this continues for another 35 days  will need to see your gyn provider for evaluation and treatment hope this was helpful best of luck with this dr r
11479,take a test home pregnancy tests are very accurate they are the same tests used in a doctors office they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period if you doubt the result you can repeat it in 12 days if you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection
11480,sure that is certainly possible you can take a pregnancy test and it will be positive if you conceived 10 or more days before usually by the time your period is due  14 days have passed since ovulation  so the test will be positive by then if you did conceive
11481,its ok when period late  sometimes you make lots of tissue in the uterus  so when period finally arrive loys of bleeding the blood is not pure blood therefore not going to be anemic in few days unless u have fibroid tumors or cancer in the uterus of older person other possibility u have micro miscarriage after only pregnant for few daysblood preg test help take med make next month on time
11482,bad idea alcohol aggravates the lining of the esophagus and stomach causes more irritaion
11483,it should work  but i notice in your description of you that you dont drink alcohol  what changed often people w  gerd pay a pain price from drinking some dont  but please do be very moderate thats always a good idea  but especialkly true if you have chronic conditions enjoy a balanced life and it should be okay if it hurts  dont do it best
11484,a bit more complex i agree that it is not wise to take omeprazole longterm while probiotics may help  that alone is likely not enough to resolve your gastritis  gerd see http:  wwwnaturalnewscom 036336_ppis_acid_reflux_side_effectshtml  http:  tinyurlcom p88fxjm for detailed advice on treatment similase sensitive stomach by integrative therapeutics is a useful supplement chinese medicine can also help
11485,dont do that it is recommended that you do not combine abilify with alcohol it can increase the chances and severity of side effects common w  abilify usage
11486,if you are not drinking continuously whole new set of problems  and only have an occasional drink not within two hours of the medication it should still be effective
11487,not as effective alcohol can decrease the effectiveness of the antibiotic with doxycycline no milk or dairy within 2 hours of taking it because it definitely affects the absorption of the doxycycline
11488,would miss it you should not get bleeding your period if you are pregnant  even if using oral contraceptives
11489,yes try another two weeks  get tested for helycobacter pylori i assume you had gastroscopic procedure
11490,gerd gerd is a chronic problem omeprazole generally has to be taken long term sometimes other medicines also a gastroenterologist should be able to help you
11491,hiatus hernai uncommon for a young man but your endoscopy will find out if anything is wrong if so  appropriate management will be given no  unless there is some major issue  not very likely you are not going to die for many decades hope all goes well
11492,ok with hernia the small hiatal hernia and gerd have no impact on your medication whether it not the medication is right for you or not is a question for your doctor you could also call the pharmacist to get more information about the drug hope this helps 
11493,may help it should create any problems and may augment any antisecretory therapy  acid wise  which is good gerd wise
11494,maybe every drop of alcohol is a depressant  and you are taking an antidepressantthat doesnt make sense also  there are isolated reports of patients having blackouts with very little alcohol
11495,no zoloft  or sertraline  is an antidepressant antianxiety medicine that works on the brain chemical serotonin in general if you have problems with depression or anxiety  alcohol is likely to worsen your symptoms and make medications like sertraline less effective so it doesnt hurt you  it just decreases or eliminates the effectiveness of your medicine
11496,maybe its not reflux lack of response to acid suppression  antacids raises several possibilities: 1 you have excessive acid production 2 your reflux is of nonacid material 3 your esophagus is severely inflamed  infected  or ulcerated 4 you have heightened esophageal sensitivity 5 your dose of omeprazole may be too low 6 your present symptoms are not refluxrelated suggest evaluation for diagnosis please
11497,further treatment there are more aggressive treatment options for the spine that are more powerful than using over the counter medications  but they get progressively more involved from non invasive alternatives such as physical therapy or chiropractic care  to interventional pain procedures which are invasive but non surgical  to even surgical considerations i would not hesitate to be seen to discuss options
11498,cerivical radiculiti sounds like you have a herniated disc or pinched nerve in your neck reproduction of the pain and numbness while bending your neck to the affected side is called a positive spurlings sign your shoulder blade pain is also characteristic of this would start with some otc antiiflams and if pain persists or weakness develops in hand or numbness persists would seek attention
11499,yes that pretty much sums up radiculopathy nerve pain
11500,can be but if your ddd and disc spondo issues are at c67  this is most likely not the cause shoulder and top of arm would more likely be c4 or c5 level with your history i would see my neurosurgeon or pain management physiatrist for evaluation not uncommon to have disease progress your history of c3c7 disease based on the history you provided suggests some worsening best to be evaluated
11501,pancreatitis yes  asap  this is a side effect of the procedure
11502,yes these are not common side effects but since the symptoms came soon after the block they may represent an adverse reaction they should be notified
11503,yes numbness and weakness in the right upper and lower extremities may indicate nerve compression at the level of the spine mri and emg could localize and prognosticate a compressive neuropathy and would give guidance to appropriate treatment options consult with a physical medicine and rehabilition specialist would be appropriate
11504,2 nerves one pinched nerve cant cause numbness in arm and leg so look for other causes  or multiple levels of disease
11505,rue could be right cervical ridiculous thy pinched nerve  brachial plexopathy or even a mono neuropathy like carpal tunnel causing proximal symptoms 
11506,pinched nerve neck pain that runs down the arm with or without numbness and tingling sounds like a pinched nerve in the neck this is usually caused by a protruding disc or bone spur touching one of your spinal nerves as it leaves your neck this can often improve on its own with rest and antiinflammatories  but if your pain lasts greater than one week or gets worse see your physician
11507,alpha lipoic acid one natural approach is to take high doses of alpha lipoic acid see natural doc for dose also  good quality marine fish oil can help w the covering on the nerves peace and good health
11508,term a kink refers to an abnormality  somewhere you need to see a nuerologist or an orthopod or a hand surgeon and get a proper diagnosis you can still work in therapy but a working diagnosis will give clarity to that treatment
11509,radiculopathy your pt is referring to a condition called radiculopathy where a nerve root in the neck is irritated or compressed causing symptoms in the arm or hand this may not be what is actually going on normally radiculopathy does not cause pain upon grasping items there can be a number of conditions that cause this symptom i would recommend evaluation by a health care professional
11510,conservative try non narcotic pain mess such as alleve  physical therapy  accupuncture  injections
11511,see your doc its tough to diagnose skin problems with words  its best to see them in person is there a chance that these are areas where you could have bruises bruises can appear yellow hope this helps
11512,moisturize the skin is probably irritated from the constant friction you need a moisturizer to keep the skin intact
11513,insect allergy allergy to insect bites is the most common cause avoiding exposure by wearing long pants when you go out may provide relief consult your doctor if the rash keeps appearing
11514,road rash road rash is usually a self limited problem and rarely requires a doctors visit the development of red bumps changes things i would see your doctor to ensure you havent developed an infection
11515,time for an eval any time you have an injury that is not getting better as you would expect  or is getting worse with increasing pain or redness  foul discharge  etc you should see a physician for an evaluation you dont want a minor and easily treatable infection to turn into something much more serious or potentially life threatening go get it looked at to make sure it is nothing serious good luck
11516,calluses calluses are a build up of the superficial layers of keratin in an area of excessive mechanical stress or pressure usually the skin is getting shear or entrapment from the underlying bones the callus  itself  probably does not itch there is likely an irritation of an underlying nerve alternatively  you may have a fungal infection if the problem persists or worsens  see a podiatrist
11517,probably irritation it depends upon what the spot looks like if it is a vesicles fluid filled or only a pimple it may indicate some infection  which could still be from skin irritation from shaving and early sign of cellulitis if it looks like a scar   crusted area it may just be from the shaving and is healing you should use otc antibiotic cream first and if persists beyond a week or worsens  get it checked
11518,seeing is believing this is one question that a md must see to give you an answer so make an appointment with a gyn soon
11519,excess carbslowcarb you have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease  caused by excess simple carbs  esp high fructose corn syrup  other sugars  grains  as well as trans fats in fried foods avoid sugars  starches  emphasize vegies  quality proteins weight loss  exercise  fish or flax oil  vit d3  natural e with mixed tocopherols help see http:  bitly 1l0v1ev i advise dr fuhrmans diet: http:  bitly 1dhw9ht

11523,hard to tell there are so many kinds of rashes and so many potential causes  it is impossible to guess on what you may have if the rash does not go away from a few days of topical cortisone cream   see your doctor the rash under the breasts may be from a fungal infection however especially if you have large breasts or are overweight
11524,hard to say your current symptoms may not be related its hard to say how do you know you inhaled a lot of water  instead of just swallowing it inhaling a lot of water is the definition of drowning so if you just swallowed a lot  probably not related you may have a cold see doc if no better soon
11525,coughing if you can get in to your primary doctor soon please do so if there is a long delay i suggest you go to the nearest emergency facility where they will look after you
11526,sounds like a virus  lots of rest and fluids  if not better or fever starts see doctor
11527,get a doctors opin you have an infection
11528,sounds viral but would see your doctor for an exam and history if he she recommends  treatment or further testing it is difficult to know what you mean by blisters and furry
11529,revisit time to go back for another appointment as most viral infections are improved after 3 weeks may not even be an infection at all  rather asthma or allergies or heartburn are possibilities
11530,yes  but it would depend on extent and exact location of damage consult with your doctor if pain persists
11531,pharyngitis smokers usually get bacterial pharyngitis and sinusitis  you need antibiotics
11532,you need and exam symptoms are suspicious for an infection  either bacterial like a strep throat or viral without the ability to examen you and to look at the sore in your mouth  the best advice would be for you to see a physician to evaluate your throat
11533,sounds like routine viral upper respiratory infection  a cold   tender swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck are common with sore throatif not better in 57 days or run a fever  see your doctor
11534,need more info need to know about allergies  previous sinus problems  nasal injury  headache condition such as migraine  family history of headaches  smoking  etc after that an actual physical exam and nasal endoscopy would be very helpful but i dont believe a safe answer can be given just with the information provided

11540,sleep study other than evaluation for anxiety also consider sleep study to find out also are you taking any medication or supplement that affect your blood pressure
11541,dizzy spells wisdom teeth may cause severe pain and should be removed but as a source of dizzy spells it is unlikely the best advice is to see an oral surgeon and have the tooth removed and see how you do
11542,dizzy spells wisdom teeth do not cause dizzy spells perhaps your anxiety about dental treatment causes it perhaps medical condition this mandates you see your physician asap for an evaluation getting dizzy and fainting can lead to more serious problems what would happen if it occurred while your were driving after medical evaluation  discuss treatment\removal of wisdom tooth with your dentist
11543,it could be all 3 hi  it could also be anxiety or a number of other things i hope that you are seeing a doctor and that you are getting specific help for your symptoms please ask again if you have a more specific question comes to mind best wishes
11544,ask the doc since you are being treated for what appears to be anxiety mood disorder these are good questions to be asked to your psychiatrist
11545,different directions there are many different possible causes of the sensation that you feel  from infections to anxiety and many in between i assume your physician performed an exam and several tests before giving you ativan however  since the sensation has moved to another area i would suggest an exam by an ent physician perhaps a fresh perspective will provide answers
11546,see u pcp or u mental health professional for consultation
11547,tos is there family personal history of migraines or seizures  has there been a concussion or whiplash injury these may be symptoms of costoclavicular compression of your brachial plexus if you have had an injury or have a straight neck should be checked out by a saavy neurologist
11548,yes fioricet should be discontinued without issues of withdrawal if you are only 1 tab day
11549,should be ok stopping your fioricet should not result in seizures  because you take a small dose keep in mind also that seizures are less likely to occur than they are when stopping a medicine like xanax
11550,butalbital withdrawal is minimal at this dose and yove been experiencing it every day as a single dose will not last 24 hours  if you are wanting to be sure this does not occur you can check an eeg first and switch to butalbital without the caffeine and cut it in half for a week
11551,no problem stopping one fioricet contains 50 mg of butalbital  along with acetaminophen and caffeine this is a very low dose and withdrawal seizures would be highly unlikely fioricet is not recommended for headaches as it can be habituating and can cause rebound headacheswithdrawal headachesmedications like fioricet can perpetuate headaches because of this effectother approaches to chronic headaches are best
11552,check with your pcp about it the combination of these meds might cause seizures  but that doesnt happen in everyone report any side effects to your pcp immediately good luck
11553,no temazepam  in my experience  would not be a way to avoid withdrawal symptoms  including seizures  that are experienced with a sudden discontinuation or significant decrease in xanax alprazolam to my knowledge  the only way to avoid these terrible effects of alprazolam withdrawal is to extremely slowly taper the dose over several months while also taking an antiseizure medication
11554,depo depo provera injections are 99 % effective in preventing pregnancy and can cause you not to have a period for up to 1 year so just be patient and if still concerned do an in home pregnancy test before heading out to see your ob
11555,it depends the inderal  first of all is not a seizure med so coming off that has to do with the reason you are on it exertional migraine  bp control etc the long term eeg was done while on carbitrol so discharges that might otherwise be seen on the eeg may be blunted suppressed i would begin to taper the carbitrol under supervision and check a routine eeg read by neurologist not computer
11556,see your neurologist while surgical treatment can greatly reduce or eliminate seizures  many patients may still require medication in a reduced amount or may be managed on a single drug the decision to discontinue medications is complex  will require much more detailed knowledge of your seizures  medical history  eegs  surgery specifics   more your neurologist has the most information and can best advise you
11557,see doctor since there is no itching  this may be from angioedema but if itching is present  then a contact allergy including eye makeup   eye drops etc may be the cause it is time to consult your eye doctor to find out
11558,slleeping pills some sleeping pills in strong enough doses can do this however if no reurrence in 10 yrs  i would put any concerns on the back burner do not take same pills again 4t0 6 % of children adolescents can have abnormal eegs there is a certain eeg pattern which could indicate future risk more likely eeg non epileptic
11559,please clarify there is nothing in your question on which to base an answer are you wondering if you are pregnant were you sexual during an ovulation period what does depo have to do with the current situation since it has been a year and you have had periods since what do you mean by the word outcome
11560,see pain management taking too much of a pain medication can trigger a seizure for example  patients who take tramadol may have seizures a pain management specialist is a physician with special training in evaluation  diagnosis  and treatment of all different types of pain and seizure
11561,see surgeon very interesting there may be some residual inflammation from the surgery or an issue with an adjacent tooth i would strongly recommend contacting the oral surgeon and inform him of this asap
11562,depends on time the healing process after any surgical procedure takes time now  depending on the type of procedure  extent of the surgery  and the time elapsed after that  the shape  sensation of the gums can vary but generally  a healthy and healed gum should be smooth  not achy  pinkish red color   without swelling  bleeding for more specific answer  please give us more specific info  if you can
11563,call your dentist for future instructions if the dentist cant be reached and it is a true emergency  go to the nearest emergency room or take tylenol advil for pain control
11564,call ur surgeon call the oral surgeon that you have scheduled the extractions with they should be able to prescribe the meds necessary to make you comfortable  but it would be even better if you can be seen earlier than in a few weeks feel better soon
11565,does she have a sore throatdid they look at her throat a throat infection can cause neck pain and ear pain if they fully examined her throat and neck and she has no fever  vomiting  rash  you can apply a warm compress and give her pain medicationif those areas were not examined  or if she has the other symptoms i would call her regular doctor or take her to the emergency room to be reevaluated
11566,neck spasm your child could have torticollis  which is spasm in the muscle of the neck there is usually underlying lymph node infection or bad throat infection or abcess i think you need to see a doctor quickly
11567,see dentist i recommend you go back to the dentist who extracted the tooth and have the extraction site examined the gingiva gums are in an active healing stage at this point and can be readily disturbed and easily bleed just by eating some hard  crusty type foods and even by brushing your teeth and gums
11568,infection  if the cavity is near the gumline  the acids and bacterial toxins can be irritating the mucosa see a local dentist asap for treatment to prevnt the problem from escalating
11569,see your dentist when wisdom teeth cause problems  they need to come out if you are experiencing pain  swollen gums  lymph nodes and it does not go away or if you find it difficult to open your mouth  you should see a dentist for evaluation  xray and wisdom teeth removal
11570,infection  if the cavity is near the gumline  the acids and bacterial toxins can be irritating the mucosa see a local dentist asap for treatment to prevnt the problem from escalating
11571,see your dentist when wisdom teeth cause problems  they need to come out if you are experiencing pain  swollen gums  lymph nodes and it does not go away or if you find it difficult to open your mouth  you should see a dentist for evaluation  xray and wisdom teeth removal
11572,dry socket if you have terrible pain 2 days or more after your surgery that is not relieved with prescription pain meds you probably have a dry socket or possibly muscular pain most likely form what you have said it is a dry socket you treat the symptoms not the appearance of the socket placing a medicated dressing in the socket will give relief within a few minutes usually
11573,yes  but yes  but unlikely in your age category  most common cause of non ear caused ear pain is tmj if ms test negative  see tmj expert if you havent seen ent doc  also see ent doc first
11574,following extraction yes  it could be an infection  or a dry socket you need to return to the dentist who treated you for a post operative evaluation
11575,post operative infection is a possibility but there are other causes that need to be considered tooth removal can also change your bite and effect chewing muscles and actions of the jaw joint your list of symptoms fit this scenario please return to the surgeon for a post operative evaluation as soon as possible good luck
11576,recurring ulcer any sore or lesion in the mouth that does not heal in 1014 days  or is recurring  needs to be examined and possibly biopsied if your dentist is unsure why you are have a lesion  have the root canal evaluated by an endodontist if the root canal is sound  and no other teeth are involved  see an oral surgeon or periodontist for an exam
11577,many causes a great resource for information regarding burning mouth is www mayocliniccom
11578,see someone see a physician or dentist for a diagnosis and advice
11579,probably radiographs are not a crystal ball  they dont disclose everything did your dentist check to see if the tooth was vital alive swelling may be from a periodontal issue  so yes  in that case root canal may not be needed more info necessary to make a proper diagnosis have your dentist reexamine you or refer you to an endodontist if s he cant determine the cause of your swelling
11580,rct needed the presence or absence of pain does not necessarily indicate the need for rct one can require rct on a tooth even though an xray does not substantiate the need the bottom line: the need for rct may require a number of tests  observations and history of symptoms and cannot be determined over the internet see your own dentist or an endodontist to determine whether or not it is indicated
11581,second opinion i think your dentist is right however  like all health care professionals dentists differ in training  experience  and in personality just look for the second opinion with an oral surgeon oral surgeons will generally provide good ethical second opinions  but there may be other factors that can influence their judgment unlikely hope it helps
11582,extent of crack a cracked tooth will be evaluated to see if it it is limited to only the crown  or if it extends vertically into the root of the tooth they can sometimes be very tricky to detect and treat be sure to ask the dentist about all the options  if the extent of the crack is clear  and how confident they are about the recommended treatment if they want to save the tooth
11583,depends maybe the tooth is cracked but not the root
11584,your dentist can hel your dentist may be able to help  it is not uncommon to have cancur sores  they usually go away in one week so if this knot does not settle down in 710 days or gets bigger or or more painful  then you should seek help from the dentist who pulled your wisdom tooth
11585,how long since normal if within a week of surgery if longer than this  see oral surgeon who extracted tooth for exam could be delayed healing  bone fragment  etc
11586,herpes other virus a first oral infection with herpes simplex virus could cause a combination of multiple ucers in the mouth and white exudate in the throat have you been been exposed  eg kissing someone with oral herpes or oral sex on genital other viruses can cause ulcers in the mouth  usually also other symptoms like diarrhea any fever get care asap if herpes  effective rx must be started soon
11587,use protection not because of the recent outbreak  but for your general protection hsv1  2 shed even when there is no visible outbreak and this is when most transmissions occur use protection regardless
11588,virus vs canker sore the answer depends upon your viral status herpes is a virus  canker sores are not if you have herpes you should not kiss or have oral sex  nor should you share cups  spoons  etc it is a communicable disease canker sores are known as aphthous ulcers they are probably autoimmune disorders  but are not spreadable you need to see a knowledgeable dentist to find out which sores you have
11589,sound like the root canal may need to be retreated or that you have another tooth acting up i would see an endodontist or my dentist for an evaluation
11590,reinfection sounds like the tooth has reinfected best option is to get back to the dentist root canal specialist who did the root canal and give you options retreatment or a minor surgery in the gum tissue above the tooth may be indicated i would not rule out a potential fracture of the root  which will present you with other decisions to make if in doubt  get more than one opinion
11591,not likely while anything is possible  these are not common symptoms of uti and other reasons for your concerns should be sought
11592,see your doctor these symptoms cant be solved in this forum you need to see your doctor
11593,maybe a physician office visit and appropriate studies will settle this hopefully and most likely its something simpler has your thyroid been checked but yoll need to do this good luck
11594,hopefully no odds are it is not cancer but could be at your age 53 you should have had a screening colonoscopy  especially if there is family history if you have not  schedule one right away
11595,possibly excess fiber and not enough fluids remember  anything with caffeine or alcohol dehydrates and therefore creates an imbalance of fiber and fluids drink 80100 ounces caffeine free alcohol free fluid daily and eat a high fiber diet if you are eating properly you do not need fiber supplements as this may cause an excess fiber and can lead to gas pains  cramping and constipation
11596,take the test if you want to know if you are pregnant  take a test in todays world you do not need to wonder if you are pregnant or not based on symptoms pregnancy tests are available at any pharmacy and in minutes you will have your answer they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period
11597,possible worth a try other thoughts would be to use simethicone for the bloating then a stool softener for the constipation sounds like you might have irritable bowel syndrome which is too complicated to treat here but generally responds to a progressive program of fiber   diet mods   bowel agents
11598,stomach upper abomen pain and swelling means a stomach problem if symptoms unrelieved by otc gas  acid control meds  go for an upper endoscopy
11599,not usually i look to your gallbladder
11600,homeopathic remedies homeopathic remedies including cimcifuga racemosa do not cause side effects they may stimulate whats innate to your healing system though homeopaths prescribe remedies according to very specific symptoms and experiences in the patient they look for a close or exact match to your symptoms  the way they trouble you its important to tell your homeopath whats happening so this is followed
11601,as i said before homeopathic medications are not tested  so no one really knows what to expect from them
11602,they could but the symptoms you are describing are very common they can be associated with colon cancer but there many more causes that are probably more common in the general population regardless of the probabilities  your symptoms warrant a visit to your doctor to help you figure out the cause best wishes  ariel
11603,poor digestion gas and bloating can be due to issues of gallbladder and digestion  sign of colon cancer  gas and bloating are late symptoms an obstruction caused by a tumor could lead to bloating and the trapping of gas within the colon if you have a family history of colon cancer  genetic polyp disorders or are concerned about your risk of colon cancer  talk to your doctor
11604,see below: see an orthopod for the arm shoulder pain and your gp for the chest pain  difficulty in breathing the arm sounds more like cubital t syndrome which is known to move towards the shoulder or chest  upper back it does not happen with tennis elbow you could have both though do you have ra as you are on enbrel why are you taking inh  tb so maybe a chest physician referral maybe helpful
11605,consider gallstones especially if pain radiates to middle of back get an ultrasound of your gallbladder
11606,you may have injured your neck which can cause all the pains not sure why you have leg pain could be unrelated trauma and strain can do the same also
11607,depending upon the distribution of the tingling it may mean one or more nerves are being compressed the median nerve gives sensations of thumb index middle and part of the ring finger the ulnar nerve to the little and part of the ring finger and the radial nerve to the back of the wrist and hands on the thumb side sometimes combinations of these mean there is a more proximal sites such as the neck or the shoulder
11608,variable not usually a part of oa and ra
11609,radicular nick pain that radiates down to the arms is often from degenerative disc disease at prices or pictures on the nerve see if physician for evaluation and xrays
11610,r o disc disease your description of the pain sounds neuropathic in nature  you need a full exam and focused neuro exam full lab tests including tfts  vit b12 vit d  lyme disease if symptoms persist an you have increased knee reflexes  mri of brain would be needed to evaluate for ms if reflexes are weak or foot drop is present mri of cervical spine is needed to rule out herniated disc or mass effect
11611,muscle strain excessive strain of pectoralis major or minor muscles could cause these symptoms did you do some heavy lifting or pulling use heat  rest   if symptoms worsen or continue see osteopath for diagnosis  physical therapist for treatment you didnt reference a cough or shortness of breath these would be symptoms of more serious problems absent neck pain  a pinched neck nerve is remote
11612,see a physician this could be a large number of things  some serious  such as an upper extremity blood clot and even a heart attack can cause some these issues be safe and get checked out also make sure you have regular breast exams as breast cancer that has reached the lymph system on the left side can cause this after you clear these possibilities  look at thoracic outlet and muscular issues
11613,no i think your docs have probably already told you it is not your heart it is something else
11614,chest wall pain i dont know your risk assessment for cad but with above negative test i might say  with some degree of certainty that your probability of having cad is low now  you use methotrexate and advil do you have rheumatoid arthritis if yes  you may have chest wall pain costochondritis follow with your doctor
11615,neurologist this may be a problem of inflammation of a structure such as a disk  vertebra  or nerve root in the neck causing such radiation of discomfort i recommend that you be evaluated by a neurologist who will order the appropriate tests
11616,usually not pain is more related to chest and mid abdomen quality of pain burning type does not radiate to neck  elbow or arms or shoulder
11617,it can but without sitting down and talking with you it is a loaded question please see your doctor to discuss asap
11618,abnormal eeg after the seizure  if aeeag is done withing 24 hrs  it is abnormal usually the anti seizure meds are not started after just one seizure if never had a repeat seizure  i would doubt the diagnosis of epilepsy consult with a neurologist
11619,no eeg is a poor predictor if you did not get a seizure you do not have a seizure disorder
11620,common question epilepsy is a clinical condition of a risk for recurrent seizures a single seizure is not epilepsy eeg does not diagnose epilepsy it is a tool used by an experienced neurologist to help with clinical decision making the diagnosis of epilepsy is a clinical decision based on thorough evaluation of many factors some use the concept of increased risk or low seizure threshold
11621,maybe nocturnal convulsions occur frequently in epilepsy convulsions occur secondary to abnormal electrical firing of nerve cells but epilepsy is a condition where these discharges are initiated spontaneously in the brain abnormal eegs reflect abnormal electrical function which may occur with nonepileptic conditions as well as epilepsy even known epileptics may have normal eegs see neurologist
11622,nope it would certainly make epilepsy a lot easier to diagnose if it were that way
11623,check with your doc even though the lobectomy surgery is done to control the intractable seizures some times you can get the seizures after the surgery as well you should make an appointment with your doctor or the neurologist and may have to have more tests and go back on some meds co control your seizures
11624,well not hopedfor this happens a certain percentage of the time following surgery  though we are always trying to lower that number sorry to hear this
11625,complex case i suspect you were misdiagnosed an eeg can show an abnormality but not define epilepsy migraine  medication effects  sleep deprivation can all affect the eeg medication for the eeg was probably not appropriate
11626,well first  that was quite a while ago  so it would bear revisiting in addition  there are many normal variants on eeg which can easily mislead there are some excellent epilepsy doctors in the twin cities you can pm me if you need info
11627,cbz typically due to weight variations and severity of condition  liver function and blood counts around 100mg twice daily going up by 100g per week depression is not typical but is reported and warned against in all seizure medications as a class
11628,eeg not much changed the way in which eegs are done has not changed from your first ones if you were taking medication it may have controlled your seizures after 2 years of control with medication  70% will come off medication without recurrence on the other hand  some people have only 1 or 2 seizures and will not have another  especially when seizures start in adolescence
11629,maybe but technology and changing criteria for certain diagnosis can confuse some pts with a long standing diagnosis but seizures are unpredictable the conditons and the substrate that allowed you to have an event may have changed as your body matured
11630,see a doctor its possible that the head injury is related to the seizure  especially if this was your friends first seizure this warrants an evauation right away
11631,slleeping pills some sleeping pills in strong enough doses can do this however if no reurrence in 10 yrs  i would put any concerns on the back burner do not take same pills again 4t0 6 % of children adolescents can have abnormal eegs there is a certain eeg pattern which could indicate future risk more likely eeg non epileptic
11632,possibly no by this point i can tell you that your probability of having ischemic heart disease is very low prinzmetal angina  an spasm of the coronary arteries without significant coronary blockage  should be in the differential but probably was already r o by your doctors acid reflux can give you pressure pain and chest wall pain due to costochondritis if you lift weight at work or at exercise
11633,probably not cardiac need more description of the chest pain  but  with all the above studies being normal  and considering your age  most probably your pain is of noncardiac causes  most commonly musculoskeletal also exercise induced asthma can present as chest pain with exercise a consultation with a lung specialist  or trial of bronchodilators before exercise may be helpful best to discuss w ur pediatrician
11634,chest pain and youth not necessarily at your age and still growing this is most likely muscular pain it is normal to feel this way i am not sure why anyone would have put you through all of the testing you went through if your pain subsides quickly and if you have no other symptoms then you do not need any further medical work up yet
11635,something else have you been evaluated for asthma  reactive airway disease if all the cardiac tests have been negative  maybe there is something else causing your pain ct angio would likely be redundant at this point
11636,you have already undergone many of the tests to exclude any ischemia to heart muscle  but the only way to rule out any congenital coronary artery anomalies is by angiogram talk with your cardiologist  but chance of finding any significant anomalies seem small to me with all negative results so far
11637,likely should that is a long list of tests i often only get an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram along with a thorough history and physical i obtain more tests if those the mri should have documented the coronary artery course please confirm your questions with your doctor though
11638,questions amp answers im curious why the folks at mayo would indulge a 26yearold with all those expensive tests when the chances of blockage are so remote sounds like blockage was ruled out and you want to believe it but dont anxiety is strictly defined as irrational worry my advice: find something else to worry about  or better yet  seek treatment to help you overcome your anxiety or maybe its ocd
11639,thorough testing yove had extensive testing  by a well respected clinic  for a condition thats rather uncommon in 26 yearold males theres always more to the story  than the testing can answer visiting another physician  for a thorough history and physical exam and a second opinion  may help reassure any concerns
11640,anxiety these are common symptoms seen with anxiety you dont have to have anxiety disorder per say  but an event or circumstance that may be causing more stress than usual sometimes the stress is internalized can manifest with shortness of breath  chest pain  and rapid heart rate try some meditation aka mindfulness and see if that helps also  follow your doctors instructions
11641,chest pain it appears your pain is likely musculoskeletal given the data an examination should suggest its source
11642,need a chest x ray the chest pain should be evaluated with a minimum of a chest x ray there are many causes  ranging from simple muscle strain and referred neck pain  to lung and esophageal tumors you are urged to have a physical exam and a chest x ray  with the possibility of needing further studies  
11643,cta i personally would be unlikely to recommend that radiation exposure in such a patient without a strong belief there was a risk benefit preponderance to benefit without more information i wouldnt predict benefit given all the other studies
11644,no no sounds like he has had enough testing
11645,no u r chest pains are noncardiac
11646,hard to avoid once and a while  you are bound to bite your cheek or lip or tongue it happens to everyone who has teeth only those will all their teeth missing are immune  and even they bite themselves from time to time when wearing dentures cut your food into small pieces  chew slowly  and avoid talking while eating
11647,see your dentist have your dentist see you to check your bite maybe your bite may need adjusting so you wont bite your lip is this a habit you have is this something that started happening recently
11648,concentrate if it just started and the in side of your lip or cheek is swollen  then you need to chew slower and concentrate on what you are doing until the swelling goes down every time you bite it it will just keep the swelling going
11649,depends depends on whether this is just a habit  if so stop :  or whether ist a problem caused by teeth that are missing  ill fitting prosthesis  or posterior bite collapse due to wear or recent dentistry
11650,cheek biting if there is a change in the moisture in the mouth the cheek can stick to the teeth and be pulled into the chewing surfaces also have you been evaluated for sleep apnea or night time grinding of your teeth bruxism you may be sucking the cheeks into the teeth at night or grinding side to side and catching the cheek between your teeth avoid alcohol containing mouth rinses before bed
11651,night guard customfitted night guard is individually designed and made in a dental office or a professional laboratory based on your dentists impression and instructions it will protect your teeth from clinching and in addition  these guards protect the soft tissues of your tongue  lips and cheek from bitingcall your dentist for more information
11652,nightguard you should see your dentist and be evaluated for a night guard need of orthodontic referral let us know what they say
11653,chew slower sounds simple  but slow down once an area has trauma  it is swollen and becomes much easier to reinjure take your time and take it easy
11654,biting if you had recent dental treatment  it can cause the bite to be changed resulting in biting once it gets bitten then it gets swollen and you tend to bite more i am not sure of your age but sleep apnea results in a lot of trauma to the oral cavity as well or as previously stated  slow down  let the bitten areas heal
11655,removing pubic hair best way is to shave it or have a barber do the job safer  in my ipinion
11656,have it removed constant biting of the cheek can create some serious problems  as well as some significant discomfort if the wisdom tooth is not erupting in the mouth into a proper and functional position  your dentist may recommend its removal
11657,common problem cheek bite as a result of wisdom tooth growing is quite common it is likely that the wisdom tooth did not in functionally erupt it is best to have your dentist check to see if you have sufficient space for functional use of this wisdom tooth if not  your dentist may advise that you have the wisdom tooth teeth removed
11658,see physician you may be coming down with and upper respiratory infection  bacterial which may need an antibiotic or a viral one that does not need an antibiotic the sound is from the muscles that help you swallow pulling on your eustachion tube when you swallow
11659,depends on the cause if its cheek biting  it can sometimes be resolved with a bite adjustment best to see your dentist for an evaluation hope this helps
11660,mouth biting this is a lot easer said then done i find that most of the time its done at night in rem sleep and can not be stoppedbi have had some success with a night guard if its occurring during day you must try to stop the habit
11661,possible only neurosurgeon or spine surgeon who saw you and your mri can answer this question  when taking in consideration physical exam  severity of symptoms and anatomical changes
11662,spinal cord edema if spinal cord edema is present  surgery to prevent further damage is usually recommended make sure the swelling is from trauma to the spinal cord and not from other causes such as a tumor or demyelinating disease example multiple sclerosis discuss these alternatives with your surgeon or radiologist
11663,there there is compression of the cervical spinal cord and neural foraminae  therefore the patient most likely needs surgery once there is compression on the spinal cord  there can be catastrophic consequences without surgery please be sure that the patient sees a neurosurgeon or spinal orthopedic surgeon immediately if the patient had numbness or weakness then they must go to the er
11664,treatment treatment depends on your brothers symptoms myelopathy myâ·eâ·lopâ·aâ·thy is deterioriation of the spinal cord of all the spinal conditions that i treat  myelopathy is the most likely to be previously misdiagnosed patients with cervical myelopathy often present with vague complaints and have not been accurately diagnosed some â€œvagueâ€ complaints include â€œtrouble walkingâ€  â€œmy legs feel weakâ€  â€œmy legs feel numbâ€  â€œelectric shocksâ€ in the back  diffuse back pain  â€œi drop thingsâ€  â€œmy hands feel stiff or like im wearing glovesâ€ many patients will not complain of neck pain at all some patients will use a cane or walker problems with fine motor skills such as buttoning buttons  handling coins  and handwriting is a common complaint global numbness or paresthesias tingling in the arms may be noted hip and thigh weakness may result in trouble rising from a chair physical exam gait examination is sensitive for detecting myelopathy look for a widebased gait or difficulty performing a heeltotoe tightrope gait romberg test loss of balance while standing with eyes closed and arms outstretched can abnormal in myelopathy neck range of motion may be limited an electric shocklike sensation down the center of the back following flexion of the neck lhermittes sign may indicate spinal cord compression weakness or sensory changes may be found  but are often nonspecific decreased vibratory sensation may indicate posteriorcolumns dysfunction atrophy of the hand or shoulder musculature may be seen in severe cases of myelopathy fasciculation in the upperextremity muscles may be present hyperreflexia in both the upper and the lower extremities is often present  although foraminal stenosis in the cervical or lumbar spine may result in an absent reflex other longtract signs include the inverted radial reflex finger flexion instead of a brachioradialis reflex  clonus and positive babinski and hoffmann reflexes tretment cervical immobilization may be tried  but is usually not beneficial except in cases of instability in cases of moderate and severe melopathy with documented progression  surgery is indicated the goal of surgery is to decompress the spinal cord this may be done from the front by removing disks and part of the vertebral body  from the back by removing the lamina  or both
11665,about 20% of people with lumbar spinal stenosis will have coexisting cervical spinal stenosis spinal stenosis is a narrowing of a bony canal structure such as the central spine canal or the exiting nerve holes known as neuroforamen which when severe enough by imaging studies will be deemed spinal stenosis
11666,it it sounds like you have a similar process occurring in both your lumbar and cervical spine spinal thecal sac and foraminal stenosis narrowing can produce inflammation in the nerves this could lead to pain in the neck  shoulder or arm many people have such narrowing and do not have symptoms however some people will have significant symptoms which would also include numbness  weakness and tingling you surgeon will evaluate you and try to determine if your symptoms are related to your mri findings
11667,c nerve compression your symptoms are created by nerve root pressure decompression is essential spinal cord compression itself can worsen without decompression intervention once decompressed  arm symptoms should improve and resolve sooner is better long term compression can lead to irreversibility
11668,myelomalacia that means that there may or may not be an area of subtle change which may represent myelomalacia in your cervical spine at the c5 6 location myelomalacia if present can signify injury that is ongoing or had been there in the past only a history and neurological exam can determine if this finding if any is actually there is of any clinical relevance please be evaluated by a spine surgeon
11669,no surgery is a poor choice for threse items in that area of spine risks out weigh benifits in my opinion instead look for another pain generator all of those items pain production is controversial they may be asymptomatic incidental findings present but not the pain generator dont extrapolate lumbar medical info to thoracic spine they are completely different what are your sumptoms
11670,probably not this doesnt sound like a surgical diagnosis  especially with no nerve compression with that being said  im sure you could find an orthopedic surgeon that would happily operate proceed with caution hope this helps
11671,see back surgeon this may or may not be the source of your discomfort you need a good history and physical to see if the findings correlate
11672,noninvasive treament though the radiology report may read annular tear  as a spine surgeon who has often correlated what was read as an annular tear on an mri report with visual inspection of the annulus in surgery  what is considered an annular tear by a radiologist equates to nothing of structural or clinical significance these mri descriptors do not represent clinically significant pain generators
11673,get checked if the diagnosis of a ligament tear is documented by mri  you need to find out if it is the type that is repairable surgery may be an option to restore integrity in the ligament if you are not able to walk  that typically indicates instability still get checked by a podiatrist or a foot ankle orthopedist they handle these types of conditions regularly
11674,you need to be nonweight bearing a boot or cast and crutches may help
11675,neck surgery you have to find out whether it is c4c5 or c5c6 and the type of surgery
11676,mri results it is possible that ms caused these demyelinating lesions there are other causes too unless there are some other causes your doctor is considering  you may be prepared to think more about ms ms can be treated effectively these days and it may not interfere with lifestyle once the diagnosis is clear  you may talk about some treatment options to prevent any more symptoms in the future
11677,possible the description is quite compatible with ms  and if a blood series screen of alternative possibilities is negative  and spinal fluid shows oligoclonal bands  you would most likely have ms  another approach is to evaluate followup mris and if lesions change  then again  your diagnosis is confirmed seek consultation with a physician who sees many ms patients
11678,rest this kind of pain has many possible causes  but is probably from running or sports shin splints are common usually it will get better with rest  ice  elevation  and wrapping your leg with an ace wrap make sure to wear cushioned arch supports in your shoes when you are active in sports or running
11679,many causes it could be a stress fracture of the tibia  shin splints  or inflammation of the muscles myositis rest  ice  and antiinflammatory medication may help if it does not  i would have it xrayedyou may need to wear a boot for a while
11680,torn cartilage sometimes a torn knee cartilage will cause pain with giving way of the leg this could also be due to a muscle strain or pinched nerve see your doctor to have this checked good luck
11681,see a doctor you see a doctor and have the knee evaluated
11682,sorry  need exam you will need an exam to get the answer to your question and symptoms
11683,beware numbness beware unexplained numbness these symptoms may not make sense to most practitioners  but may be the earliest unexplained signs of worrisome conditions like transverse myelitis or multiple sclerosis these are rare but serious diagnoses that often began with numbness if these persist or seem to worsen  see your neurologist many a person with these diagnoses have initially been labeled: crazy
11684,muscle pop this could be a muscle tear and needs evaluation for proper healing  see your orthopedist for assistance
11685,no knee problems can lead to hip problems but there is no direct relationship between a knee scope and hip grinding
11686,not really the two are not connected in that way
11687,be seen many potential causes  but i would certainly let your surgeon know it could be as simple as the altered gait you have had in your recovery could have aggravated your hip and ankle but it could also be early signs of a blood clot or infection again  let you surgeon know and he can take a look thank you
11688,expected pain the postop course after a knee replacement is challenging  pain can often be up and down the entire leg a rare but real concern can be that of a blood clot which can occur for up to 6 weeks out any such concerns should be conveyed to your treating surgeon asap let me or her know and get direction in what to do next 
11689,varies it varies somewhat  based upon the specific cause it might be reasonable to ice it down and rest it  if it does resolved over 35 days it probably was a minor injury if it does not get better  or worsens at any point  i would not hesitate to be seen for it
11690,muscles a late teenager with aches and pains in the legs and knees should evaluate his level of physical activity and whether too much was pursued too soon exercise and sports should be undertaken as gradually increased activity within a stepped up program to allow the soft tissues to gradually adjust and strengthen if problem persists  a doctors evaluation is in order
11691,may relate  but ctmri typically done in static position  does not show what happens in motion or other positions  most importantly does not show pain or function  these are clinical judgement issues pain meds listed usually a trap  muddy thinking docs paid for ds+dxtx workeffort  not your success usually much better help available but have to search  insurance es costs  es quality vs selfpay sad 
11692,it can the imaging quoted indicates presence of degenerative disc disease which may explain the symptoms related
11693,mri mri is inherently better in identifying smaller abnormalities positional headache and neck pain may be related to sinus disease or cervical spine disorders mri of neck and or or mri cervical spine may be in order to make you feel better  most patients with such vague symptoms rarely have any significant findings in radiological studies
11694,cervicl radiculopath it is possible that you have cervical radiculopathy but the ct or mri should have seen that usually however this does not manifest with face tingling around the eyes and nose bells palsy is also a possibility as this would not show up on an mri or ct scan im curious to know if you saw a neurologist as this would be a good specialist to see
11695,see a spine surgeon you may need further evaluation if symptoms persisting you may need mri of your cervical spine  which may pick up other problems not seen on xray which may then identify the cause of your symptoms
11696,many causes you may need a cat scan or mri to fully diagnose why you mhave this get examined by neurologist
11697,see rheumatologist arthritis in back is usually not the cause of the pain see a physician eg  rheumatologist who has skills in treating back problems
11698,anxiety depression do biofeedback and regular walking exercises
11699,lower down  could be from mid or low back area consider mri of those areas
11700,see your doctor this is one of those problems where a visit to your doctor is necessary to figure out whats going on only after a thorough evaluation  including examination and possibly labs and other tests  can your doctor correctly diagnose you and treat you effectively
11701,can not pin point th these symptoms are non specific for any condition but if your symptoms are persisting still  then you shouild see your doctor for examination and perhaps have some tests to find the cuase headaches can cause nausea but if headache is severe and persistent you may need to have your head brain checked with a ct scan or mri scan of the brain
11702,shoulder blades back pain between the shoulder blades is fairly common and can be the result of desk work  posture issues  and stress the good news is that your tests dont show bone or  presumably  disk problems make sure you have good posture and good back support if you are sitting in an office consider therapeutic massage and acupuncture
11703,chest mri would probably be unlikely to add anything
11704,more info needed where is the pain exactly assuming the tspine mris and ct were normal not uncommonly  problems in the mid to lower cervical spine can manifest as pain in the upper back  in and around the shoulder blades mri cervical spine can be considered if this is the case a musculoskeletal ultrasound performed by an experienced doctor may provide the answer chest mri unlikely to add benefit
11705,possible it could be referred pain it could also be muscle spasm in the area
11706,probably yes i would agree that it is probably the cervical stenosis
11707,hpt possibly regarding pregnancy some early pregnancy tests are able to detect pregnancy up to 6 days prior to your anticipated period if you used a regular home pregnancy test  it may have been too early for that
11708,maybe todays home pregnancy tests are very accurate and not affected by foods  herbs  common illnesses  sexually transmitted diseases  or medications a correctly done urine test will give a reliable result 3 weeks after sex or when conception might have happened or 1 week after missing a period if done sooner  a positive result is likely real  but a negative result may be due to testing too soon
11709,possibly home pregnancy tests wont turn positive until about the time yod start your next expected period if its not positive then  repeat it in 1 week
11710,not likely mainly because of the negative test it is certainly not uncommon for menstrual cycles to be late if still no cycle within the next week  repeat the pregnancy test
11711,possibly it would be very early pregnancy  u should check a home test if it is neg may have just been an offcycle period for future reference: the plan b morning after is available otc for just these unexected occurrences it has high efficacy  but probably wouldnt have worked if you had definitely ovulated when you thought u did
11712,possibly do home pregnancy test
11713,possible possible symtoms of pregnancy include missing your period  nausea  feeling tired and swollen or tender breasts pregnancy tests pick up on human chorionic gonadotropin hcg which increases with pregnancy normally  you can do a urine pregnancy test about a week after you miss your period a blood pregnancy test ordered by your doctor can detect pregnancy even earlier
11714,wait and test none of the symptoms you mention confirm or rule out pregnancy you may want to wait a little longer and if in doubt go ahead and take a pregnancy test in the mean time i am also concerned regarding you having nipple discharge this is something that you need to check with your health care provider too
11715,it is low probability if u are taking the pill correctly likewise  conception occurs ovulation which occurs around day 14 from the first day of your last cycle you may have a bladder infection i would consider getting a gyn exam gd luc
11716,what you are bleeding and the test is negative isnt that proof of not being pregnant
11717,possible  possible  yes  though not very likely as you probably know  ectopic pregnancy can be very dangerous  so if you are having abdominal pain  it would be a good idea to see your doctor right away obviously  a home pregnancy test that is positive would require a doctor visit
11718,please see below home pregnancy test is negative but just you missed 3 days  this could still be pregnancy you want to wait or if your nausea and bloating is severe  then its wise to see a doctor
11719,yes there are thousands of lymph node located around the body that help screen out germs in the body serum before it returns to the circulation there are many in the neck  head  behind the ear at rest these are often 1 4 inch in diameter and may grow to marble sized when reacting to a stimulus bug bites  or viral infections can increase their sizethey should shrink down to nl size over a few wks
11720,if it gets infected lymph nodes swell up to help protect the body from outside invasions like infections if this is not the case your physician can tell about other causes on your examination
11721,lymphadenitis lymph nodes drain infection  be it in ears  throat  head or mouth they will enlarge when recent infection occurs in any of above organs
11722,swollen lymphnode infection can cause swelling of lymphnode if it stays swollen for more than 4 weeks then it needs to be evaluated
11723,definitely  yes a tooth abscess is a pocket of pus thats caused by a bacterial infection tooth infections can spread to other areas of the mouth and cause extensive tooth loss  or compromise the immune system – and although rare  may become life threatening the swollen glands of the neck and enlarged lymph nodes are common symptoms of the tooth abscess see a dentist asap
11724,yes depending on which tooth is infected  however if it persists after 6 weeks and tooth infection is resolved  then need to have a medical evaluation for more serious causes
11725,many kind  including syphilis see a doctor
11726,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs carries things too big to go into the arteries veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria viruses cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
11727,not likely lymph nodes on one side of the neck need to be evaluated by your physician and a complete physical needs to be done if you are smoking  please stop
11728,most likely not probably not in a person as young as you if 1 they are not growing  2 they have been stable for years  3 you dont have symptoms of fever  weight loss  etc but get them checked  lumps near the midline can be related to thyroglossal duct cysts and those on the sides may be branchial cleft cysts  both congenital abnormalities that should be treated
11729,probably nothing acne confined to a shoulder may be from rubbing we see this in men who benchpress large amounts of weight most adults have one or more palpable lymph nodes in the neck  and if they are not rockhard  fixed to other structures  or growing rapidly  theyre best ignored glad yore a good observer of the body good luck
11730,yes if you think you may have a peridontal or apical abscess you should see a dentist asap
11731,possibly infected abscessed teeth can cause lymph nodes to enlarge so can gum disease  ear infection  sinus infection  etc you need to be seen by your dentist if your lymph nodes enlarged  the infection is spreading
11732,probably not causes of enlarged lymph nodes are infection  inflammation  or less likely neoplasm hyperthyroidism usually means overactive thyroid gland if you have persistently enlarged lymph nodes in the neck  you should have a medical evaluation
11733,no running for at  least 3 months  if i was the surgeon your surgeon will be the only one to answer that as only he knows what he saw and did exactly also depends on your progress from the surgery any pain or swelling check with your surgeon good luck
11734,meniscus best to consult your orthopedic surgeon
11735,permission should be granted by your surgeon
11736,no toe touch weight bearing status indicates that you cannot drive
11737,knee locking you should have this discussion with your surgeon if he does not give you a satisfactory answer and solution  it is okay to get a second opinion
11738,microfracture it depends upon the joint stability and the extent location of the microfracture bracing or activity modification may help in the first 6 weeks  check with your orthopedic surgeon
11739,knee surgery obviously it is important to use your right leg to drive if the surgery was on your left probably would be able to drive immediately good idea to have a temporary handicap hanger from doc usually weight bearing after micro fracture is restricted for 612 weeks depending on location and extent driving will have similar restrictions discuss this with your surgeon
11740,unclear what bone is affected direct your question to your surgeon
11741,it depends  mostly on how you are doing if you can walk  sit  and move around  and if your wound is healing well  you should be able to fly after your discharge from the hospital
11742,post tka pain the most severe pain is in the first 48 hrs it should gradually start lessening after that it depends upon how much deformity is there preop also pain is a subjective measure usually minimal pain by a month
11743,it may not be gone some are fortunate to have the surgery and shortly there after once the wounds healed  they have no pain at all many will have great improvement of pain  but never completely resolved after the replacement surgery it is a big surgical procedure with significant risks benefits  so do your research and discuss with doc thoroughly good luck to you
11744,depends recovery fro simple knee arthroscopy meniscal debridement  loose body removal  plica excision takes ~6 wks if you rehab diligently you can get back faster sports in 34 weeks arthroscopic ligament reconstruction eg acl  meniscus repairs  or articular cartilage procedures microfracture  aci  etc require longer rehabilitation  often 612 months talk to your surgeon about your case
11745,is not neoprene sleeve may help with postop swelling following the immediate postop time after two weeks is not necessary to wear any external immobilization specially after simple arthroscopyyou should concentrate in rehabilitation of the knee with proper exercise program directed by your surgeon
11746,it can be beneficial but you dont necessarily need to wear one it may help to keep your knee from giving out as it can increase your proprioception until your quadriceps is strong enough
11747,this is serious im glad yore on isotretinoin and this is appropriate for a woman in your situation hopefully yoll get a good result other meds that may help if you relapse include spironolactone and the oral contraceptive pill lasers may be an adjunct for you im really glad yore managing this and wish you the best for as long as you need to be treated
11748,laser acne treatment research has found laser acne therapy effective in controlling and preventing acne breakouts laser acne therapy is safe and can have longterm beneficial results different lasers and laser protocol has been developed to treat this skin condition
11749,manage it acne cannot be cured red postacne lesions must heal on their own you must manage it until it remits on its own it is unrelated to hygiene or lifestyle and only marginally to diet no pop cure works anyone telling you otherwise is lying if topical benzoyl peroxide as tolerated has not cleared you in two weeks  get with your personal physician who can add a prescriptionstrength rx
11750,manage it acne cannot be cured red postacne lesions must heal on their own you must manage it until it remits on its own it is unrelated to hygiene or lifestyle and only marginally to diet no pop cure works anyone telling you otherwise is lying if topical benzoyl peroxide as tolerated has not cleared you in two weeks  get with your personal physician who can add a prescriptionstrength rx
11751,none of them nothing you can do on your own is going to touch your acne scars if you want them managed and less visible  you can get with a dermatologist or plastic surgeon who can offer microsurgery  fillers  or laser rx im sorry you got the scars in the first place and that yove been frustrated with products that offer misleading claims
11752,its not too late get in to see dermatologist for treatment options including topical tazarotene  lasers  micro needling  especially young skin does really well
11753,medication long term care for wide spread acne includes salicylic acid wash  prescription topicals  and a physician following your situation presently it sounds out of control and you may benefit from laser skin care as well as oral medication consider your acne a medical condition which it is and take it seriously although it is miserable to have it  acne is treatable
11754,612 months it can take 612 months for the skin to totally recover from changes caused by accutane
11755,options exist consult with a board certified plastic surgeon or dematologist to evaluate your personal options this may include lasers  chemical peels  dermabrasion or prescription skin care there are many options and you need a regimen tailored to your specific situation and expected results
11756,meds many patients do well with over the counter benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid preparations some patients require topical or oral antibiotics or retinoids as well if the over the counter meds alone dont control your acne after a month of daily use  see a doctor for additional treatment options it is important to be persistent  and some patients get worse before they get better
11757,facial redness it can help  but other moisturizers are also available you might try coconut oil
11758,laser for acne scars the active acne should be controlled prior to laser treatment for acne scars to minimize risk of infection
11759,yes first we use the laser to shut down the inflamed oil glands and then we use the co2 laser to treat the acne scars you would want the oil to be under control before undergoing the ablative laser so you do not have so much oozing acne can be triggered by sun  stress  hormones  lack of sleep  picking and more control that first and the scarring second
11760,probably not a sudden cardiac arrest sca is a rare phenomenon it almost always occurs in patients who have cardiac disease: either electrical  mechanical  or related to a heart attack it sounds as though all of your testing has been normal this should provide some relief from your anxiety
11761,in 40 or 50 years why in the world would you be fixated on the possibility of sudden cardiac arrest at 30 yrs old take reasonable care of yourself  dont smoke  watch your weight  get some regular exercise and your heart should continue to do its thing for the foreseeable future working on that anxiety with a professional would also help
11762,anxiety your cardiac risk is low get help for your anxiety so you can enjoy life
11763,less likely control you anxiety and talk to your pcp for further evaluation and treatment
11764,a delusion is a belief that persists in spite of contrary evidence we humans are very good at false perceptions  false interpretations   false conclusions the most common error is to look only for confirming evidence look for evidence that could prove your belief is false what other explanations are possible  which are most likely talk to a mental health professional who treats anxiety
11765,see a psychiatrist there are a number of different anxiety disorders please see a psychiatrist about the treatment  especially therapy  that would be right for you best wishes
11766,why treadmill stress testing with good exercise tolerance has a very good predictive value when normal it is great that all your tests are normal why would you be worried any other history or experience
11767,sca ha those findings bode well if there is no history of sca ha in your family  spend your time worrying about something else
11768,sca ha those findings bode well if there is no history of sca ha in your family  spend your time worrying about something else
11769,probably not risk of sudden cardiac death with all these normal studies would be very low  especially if there is no family history of sca
11770,not anxiety anxiety  panic attacks frequently cause shortness of breath  as well as many other physical symptoms im glad you have such good results from your heart and lung evaluations so far i dont know what your doctors will come to  about your situation  but heres info about panic attacks: http:  wwwmayocliniccom health panicattacks ds00338 dsection=symptoms
11771,not unusual costochondritis usually results in generalized chest wall inflammation there is likely to be associated fatigue and lassitude as might be the case with any activation of the immune system it typically improves with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
11772,stress test normal if your stress test is normal at your young age then it is a pretty good sign that your heart is healthy at this point the best things you can do to keep your heart healthy are to manage the risk factors for heart disease:keep bp normal  dont smoke  exercise regularly  keep cholesterol normal  manage sugars if diabetic  and eat a healthy diet if anxiety is an issue try counseling or meditating
11773,dont worry dont worry  but follow up with your doctor to make sure all bases are covered let your doctor do the worrying  if any is to be done trace of blood and protein is abnormal  but physical trauma like being hit in the back  etc could cause that result it may not mean any ongoing illness at all talk with your doctor  and ask all the questions you need to
11774,guaifenesin guaifenesin can help loosen phlegm and thin secretions  making them easier to expel with coughing or clearing of throat
11775,throat mucus greetings the fastest way to rid of the mucus in your throat is to gargle with salt water also make sure you are drinking enough liquids  sleep with a humidifier and consider mucinex
11776,cough the cough mechanism is designed to bring mucus from your bronchial airway and pharyngeal airway to your throat so that you can either swallow or spit it out
11777,you can file them with an emory board you can get a pedicure or see a podiatrist who will explain why you are getting it and offer possible solutions so they dont come back
11778,hydrate well  gargle saltwater gargles are very helpful mix a teaspoon of salt in 8 oz of warm water – gargle with this several times a day you can gargle with aloe vera juice a couple of times per day a mixture of chamomile tea with honey  a small amount of lemon juice is good
11779,talk to your doctor treatment of specific problems must be individualized
11780,use biocorneum or other silicone based products  and stay out of sun and time will help
11781,valtrex  famvir if you have sever or frequently recurrent fever blisters it is vest to treat with oral antiviral for a week to lower the viral count if recurrences are frequent a preventive dies of medication one to two pills a day will prevent recurrences document severity and length of episodes to determine if treatment of this episode or longer term is better gor you  
11782,prevention agree with dr  w if you have 4 or more outbreaks a year  consider taking daily prevention antiviral drug for a period of time also do things to be well: eat right  exercise  get rest  balance work play the healthier we are  the more our bodies can kick germs
11783,see doctor and get a diagnosis and then it can be treated
11784,ask md who diagnosed throat mucous can be seen at many different levels in the throat and for many different reasons the doctor who performed the endoscopy can probably clarify for you for example  there can be mucous where the sinuses drain from problems such as allergies or sinusitis there can be mucous lower in the throat also visualized via a camera passed through the nose from reflux or infection
11785,otc abreva abreva otc is quite effective at eliminating fever blisters on the lips if inside the mouth  you should see a dentist because fever blisters could also be caused by herpes type 1 there are different prescription meds to treat both of these conditions
11786,possibly yes get  yourself checked out by your pcp or go to an er if a blood clot is suspected  so a doppler scan be done to exclude confirm it generally its due to a pulled muscle  sprained ligament  or a rupture of a cyst behind the knee these are more commonly seen good luck  happy holidays
11787,calf pain the symptoms you describe could certainly be consistent with a blood clot  but may also be explained by a ligamentous injury or something known as a bakers cyst any of these diagnoses  but especially the blood clot  need to be evaluated in the er asap and can be easily diagnosed using an ultrasound
11788,possible clot you need to be evaluated to rule out a blood clot a clot is a serious medical condition see a doctor asap
11789,more info if ultrasound negative unlikely dvt any associated symptomsswelling  etc
11790,it could be less to worry about: chronic muscle fatigue  arthritis  gout  rheumatoid  sciatica  nerve impingement  have a physician check you out and mention your concerns to be sure they know about those as well
11791,dvt hi  if your ultrasound is negative then its very unlikely to have blood clot in leg  most likely you have some sort of muscle tiredness and cramping due to overuse  trauma due to exercise  dehydration  electrolyte imbalance but most likely reason would be overuse of the muscles in leg
11792,plantar fascitis where exactly on the bottom of the foot if its the bottom of the heel you might have plantar fasciitis with concomitant achilles tendon tightening which can cause cramping of the calf and lower thigh i suggest seeing a podiatrist and also getting a nerve conduction velocity test to check your nerves lastly to rule out blood clot an ultrasound of the lower leg should be performed
11793,ans well need more information any swelling or pain or redness can you walk without pain you are best to see your doctor
11794,because you mention it  i would be concerned have it looked at
11795,unlikely if no eye pain when you do not rub and no vision change  no drainage  no redness then not to worry if it continues for a week or more or if any of the others symptoms listed above start then see your doctor hope this helps best of luck
11796,not likely doppler ultrasound is very accurate at detecting deep venois thrombi
11797,ultrasound would be the first imaging test to evaluate for a bakers cyst or dvt
11798,could be a cyst u need an xray to rule out any bone causes
11799,not always low blood pressure is only an issue if you are symptomatic with it common sx included fainting or feeling extremely dizzy going from a seated or recumbent position virtually all studies suggest an lower   mi or ashd risk the lower the bp it should only be treated if you have sx
11800,fainting low blood pressure is usually a part of fainting
11801,cuff size if the size of the blood pressure cuff is too big it can cause a falsely low reading the opposite is also true
11802,heart condition this is likely a heart condition that needs to be evaluated asap when the heart is not working efficiently or effectively  the heart may not pump as fast as it should or as strong as it should this will limit blood flow equaling low blood pressure this will cause less blood flow going to the brain and hence causing dizziness
11803,valve issue it can be a sign of a specific type of heart valve condition i recommend seeing a cardiologist for an evaluation
11804,nothing in health  your body lowers your diastolic pressure to whatever is required to maintain proper perfusion of blood to your entire body theres really no such thing as low diastic pressure in my opinion  and ive never seen in four decades in medicine anything to make me think this is something you should worry about
11805, pots although there is very little other information  you could possibly have paroxysmal orthostatic tachycardia syndrome the increase in heart rate would in particular occur upon standing this can be accompanied by associated decrease in blood pressure  with lightheadedness  fatigue  excessive thirst if chronic  can prompt cold extremities  shortness of breath  headache  restless sleep  gi symptom
11806,heart rate nothing if no symptoms
11807,your md can tell you if you have been exercizing aerobically your rest pulse might be under 60 if not or you are dizzy or light headed see your md asap your pulse should go up with exercize if you are young and very fit you might be able to pass 200 since you onlyleft a little info i think you should talk to an md he she may reasure you or have you see an excercize physiologist or recommend a stress test
11808,any level from low to normal to high can occur with either heart attack or stroke with very high 150and greater systolic and 100 or so diastolic a number of bad things can happen: aortic teardissection  and heart attack or stoke may evolve with high pressure intracranial aneurysm may burst  o r the brain may bleed complex sets of diagnostic issues
11809,always a risk if bp is skyhigh  such as malignant hypertension  risk of brain hemorrhage is high  but even modest chronic elevation can increase risk for stroke and or heart problems in other words  follow american heart association recommendations and keep bp under tight control
11810,early vs late igm is the immunoglobulin noted for coming out early in response to any illness  it fades over time while igg come out a bit later and stays up longer if you have a positive igm it indicates a early response  while igg would probably show up in a few months at which point the igm would have declined
11811,probably not i dont think a service dog would be of much help to you instead  you need to be evaluated for correctable causes of dizziness if there are none  a cane or walker may be help
11812,highly unlikely ovulation occurs mid cycle  14 days before her period  so as described  the time line you provided would not be likely to cause pregnancy
11813,take the test if you want to know if you are pregnant  take a test in todays world you do not need to wonder if you are pregnant or not based on symptoms pregnancy tests are available at any pharmacy and in minutes you will have your answer they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period
11814,unprotected sex you always have a chance of pregnancy if you do not take your oral contraceptives according to directions and of course the same for unprotected sex
11815,fact unprotected sex with fertile partner=possible pregnancy under any circumstance or condition no matter what else is happening or not
11816,you have periods so you are not pregnant if they are normal periods   to be sure get a pregnancy test done to ease your mind   see your doctor for several available contraceptive measures   be aware unprotected sex besides pregnancy you can get sexually transmuted disses
11817,pregnancy very hard to say with only 6 days post unprotected sex get a pregnancy test and if negative repeat if you missed your period
11818,yes unprotected sex is the way in which people become pregnant anytime there is unprotected sex pregnancy is always a possibility get a home pregnancy test kit and check if your period was on schedule your test should be positive if you are indeed pregnant
11819,can i be pregnant i am not sure about your question i think it would be pretty simple it is time to get a pregnancy test are you telling us about your sexual activity to get a rise out of us or to surprise us that you are not taking the possible making of a new baby seriously i think that any time someone has sex without protection they must be prepared to accept the fact that pregnancy is possibility
11820,not pregnant please resubmit your question to include where you learned that bleeding in any way could represent pregnancy birth control works taking it daily means you are taking it as prescribed you bled you are not pregnant viable pregnancy stops vaginal bleeding
11821,yes you need a pregnancy test see your doctor
11822,take the test if you want to know if you are pregnant  take a test in todays world you do not need to wonder if you are pregnant or not based on symptoms pregnancy tests are available at any pharmacy and in minutes you will have your answer they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period
11823,take the test if you want to know if you are pregnant  take a test in todays world you do not need to wonder if you are pregnant or not based on symptoms pregnancy tests are available at any pharmacy and in minutes you will have your answer they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period
11824,pregnant nope not in any way
11825,yes uti which can become kidney infection can cause pain and frequency with urination as well as blood in urine you will need to go to doc to check urine culture  check temperature and possible kidney ultrasound depending on clinical findings
11826,might b uti or yeast the blood in the urine could be a persistent uti  ie  didnt get it cleared or the blood in the urine might be vaginally from a light cycle or infection of the vagina like with a yeast infection probably should be seen if not quickly improved with a lot of water drinking or worsening symptoms
11827,not specific enough oral infection can mean lots of things infections in the mouth are caused by bacteria  fungus thrush  viruses herpes  etc  you need to be more specific and hopefully get a helpful answer
11828,yes urine tests  like all diagnostic tests  are not perfect additionally  if you are taking antibiotics when you submit the specimen  the sample may appear normal despite an ongoing infection lastly  if your infected kidney is completely obstructed ie by a stone  the urine tests may look negative
11829,yes it can interfere with the identification of hcg in the urine during very early pregnancy
11830,yes spotting a week before your period is due suggests that you didnt ovulate lately if you havent missed a period  spotting is usually not due to pregnancy if a urine test first morning urine is negative  a blood test will generally be negative also
11831,see urologist there are many causes of bloody urine it is rarely a serious cause at age 28 but you need a urological evaluation to diagnose the causebest wishes
11832,hmm  well the negative test and fact that your period is now present would go against being pregnant it does sound as if you were pregnant though in the recent past miscarriages are more common than you would think  and maybe your body was not ready for pregnancy not definitively sure though  you need to see the gyn doctor as you need an exam to treat you either way best wishes  god bless
11833,uti urine analysis if positive for infection such as positive leukocyte esterace  nitrite  bacteria and wbcs it does not differentiate between a kidney  bladder or urethral infection if you see sediment or oxalate crystals or under microscope crystals can be seen then stones can be suspected
11834,analyze this anal fissure or hemorrhoids are common causes of rectal bleeding home treatment includes warm sitz baths  stool softeners  high fiber diet  hydration be advised that colon cancer or vascular lesions can also cause bleeding so a gastroenterologist can help you and perform endoscopy to visualize serious problems
11835,have it evaluated i suppose if you were a contortionist and had a mirror you might figure this out by looking however  spotting a fissure would not rule out having a hemorrhoid internally that could be your main problemhaving you doc or a gi doc do a formal anoscopy look at and up your anus would sort this out if you just have minor itching down there  local application of emollients like coco butter can help
11836,see your dentist wisdom tooth extraction is a surgical procedure and is not completely riskfree pain  swelling and infection following surgery is usually at its worst 24 – 48 hours after surgery after that it should subside more and more every day and after 7 days stop your symptoms could be a serous problem see your dentist or an oral surgeon for postop appointment and treatment
11837,call surgeon your infection may require antibiotics
11838,likely unrelated unrelated treat the high bp follow fibroid size and menses
11839,yes these do not necessarily exclude forms of exertion i would not hold my breath during the exercises as that puts extra pressure on the roids
11840,depends if you are having an acute flare of the hemorrhoids or anal fissure then no doing anything that puts pressure on the rectum from the inside or out can aggravate the problem
11841,diet not exercise anal fissures are caused by passing large  hard stools hemorrhoids are due to straining to pass hard constipated stools  straining  heavy lifting be sure you are drinking plenty of water daily and getting plenty of fiber in your diet exercise will not prevent either
11842,exercises:no anal fissures are caused from an overly tight anal sphincter muscle: thats the muscle that keeps the anus closed and relaxes when you poop keeping your stool soft can prevent hemorrhoids  by eating lots of fiber  drinking lots of water  exercising sometimes anal fissures just happen  even if you do all that there are some prescription ointments that can relax the muscle  heal: see a doctor
11843,vaginal discharge see a md for std testing if you are sexually active and evaluation for a vaginal infection
11844,droopy eyelid there are several causes of a droopy eyelid your best bet would be to have your eyes evaluated by a board certified facial plastic surgeon
11845,ptosis or droopy eyelid  has many possible causes you are quite young to have this developing based on this  you should have a complete eye evaluation to rule out any significant causes for this if this is just an agerelated problem  then the droopy lid can be surgically corrected
11846,you can take either  but i would recommend miralax it dissolves in 8 oz of any fluid  such as water until you can see the doctor  you can also apply some healing ointment  such as aquaphor to your anal area if its a fissure  that may even heal it working on the constipation is the real factor here so try to increase the fiber and fluids in your dietand certainly see your doctor
11847,constipation yes it is safe to take miralax and i would take one or two capfuls a day and adjust as needed to have one or two soft stools a day
11848,manage it acne on the trunk usually requires both a topical such as benzoyl peroxide and systemic rx suc has an antibiotic for at least a while if it itches  you may be allergic to the bacteria  or it may be someting other than acne dermatitis herpetiformis can do this your physician is your best guide
11849,manage it acne on the trunk usually requires both a topical such as benzoyl peroxide and systemic rx suc has an antibiotic for at least a while if it itches  you may be allergic to the bacteria  or it may be someting other than acne dermatitis herpetiformis can do this your physician is your best guide
11850,maybe not  but it can be hard to tell if a woman is pregnant because many of the symptoms seen in early pregnancy can also happen in nonpregnant women a urine pregnancy test gives a reliable result if done correctly one can test about 3 weeks after sex when conception might have occurred  or 1 week after missing a period an obgyn doctor can evaluate any persistent or worrisome symptoms
11851,there are a lot of reasons why you could have your symptoms but its not unreasonable to complete a home pregnancy tests even if its negative  you may want to repeat it at the seven day mark of when you missed your period to make sure any negative testing is accurate if that remains negative and your symptoms persist  seek the input of your doctor
11852,pregnancy if you are sexually active and do not use birth control  you may become pregnant if you missed a period  get a pregnancy test if you are pregnant  be sure to take prenatal vitamins and routine prenatal care for a healthy baby
11853,take the test if you want to know if you are pregnant  take a test in todays world you do not need to wonder if you are pregnant or not based on symptoms pregnancy tests are available at any pharmacy and in minutes you will have your answer they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period
11854,hard to say when did you perform the 2 tests if before you missed your period then  theyre not valid also  if yore on medications for a uti i dont know if that can affect these tests wed have to defer to an ob gyn on that question id repeat the hpt in 7 days for now  behave as if you were pregnant if still negative you may have just had a month without ovulation
11855,possible do a home test if neg your obgyn can do a blood preg test  and if you were my pt in boca raton  fl iwowuld do an exam blood work and an ultrasound so we both would know what is going on
11856,test do pregnancy test to eliminate doubts
11857,sure anything is possible if the pain is linked to your periods cycles  it is possible
11858,yes yes
11859,see below usually if there is cramping related to pregnancy it is mild classic pregnancy symptoms dont occur until you actually miss your period so  if you havent missed your period  it isnt likely to be pregnancy
11860,yes no form of birth control is 100%  do a home test  if get in 4 a blood test a pregnancy with an iud is not a good thing
11861,differs in each that type of question is very difficult to answer since it depends on each individual patient and their bodys tolerance for each of those medications some people can tolerate all of those medications together and then some and others could not even tolerate the lowest dose of any of them however  klonopin probably would cause the least amount of nausea in any given person
11862,talk to your psych i would personally stop the cymbalta gradually while adding in saphris  latuda  depakote  or fanapt discuss with your psychiatrist first
11863,if your doc advises can be taken but you need medical supervision
11864,neuropsych evaluatio you are taking a lot of medications and obviously have a complex disorder several of the medicaitons can cause the difficulty focusing  attending and idistractibility characteristic of adhd before you add adderall  you should have an assessment of the medications you already take for necessity and efficacy
11865,sounds like you knew there were better ways to manage side effects than stopping the cymbalta sounds like you felt the cymbalta was helping you and you wanted to make it work good for you if i have misunderstood you  let me know  hope it is working well for you now
11866,not necesstsartly your doc is trying to find a combination of meds to control your sx klonopin is safe  effective for anxiety  also helps mood stabilization
11867,i guess  your regimen of tegretol  etc is not helping enough for your anxiety  so your doc is suggesting you take the klonopin on a regular basis i agree with dr jacobson that you may wish to discuss some of the atypicals  especially latuda which may have a better se profile but even so  if you are already being treated for diabetes  your drs just need to work together
11868,klonopin amp mood im not aware that klonopin  xanax or ativan cause major depression or have a significant if any effect on serotonin levels in fact  all 3 medications can be used with antidepressants to target anxiety symptoms biggest concern is mild sedation and not wanting to induce drug dependence or give to anyone who will abuse these meds if depressed mood develops  stop or lower dose and reassess
11869,need more specifics there are different types of these medications  such as long  intermediate  or short acting cardizem its best to take the medications as prescribed  as they could either wear off  or accumulate too much in your blood stream  becoming toxic bring your medication bottles to your next physician visit  and have them review each bottle and how the medications are to be taken discuss options
11870,most likely never while each of these medications have some potential to affect liver function tests  it being greatest in tegretol  most of the changes tend to be benignor harmless i would worry to much  particularly if you doctors continue to monitor this periodically best of luck
11871,not everybody has it if for 8 years on all these medications you didnt have issues   it is likely that you will not have anything bad in the future also not all the medications in this list cause liver fn abnormalities get periodic check up of liver enzymes once in 6 months that should be enough  which could be ordered by your pcp
11872,yes there are no reported drug interactions between these medications the flexeril could make you drowsy and sometime the cymbalta makes people drowsy i would avoid driving or operating machinery in case you are one of those people that it makes drowsy
11873,side reactions im not quite sure what your problem is  but isnt it rather clear that the medications you are receiving are not really solving your problems my guess is that your medication regimen is making you worse you may want to see a board certified psychiatrist for this if you were my patient  i could imagine first tapering and discontinuing those meds and seeing what yore like off of them
11874,it is a stimulant stimulants can cause irritability also need to think of possible hypomania
11875,pregnancy if you are pregnant you will always show hcg in your blood  except perhaps for the first few days of pregnancy
11876,no all women who are pregnant will have hcg detectable in their blood and urine if tested too early approximately less than 2 weeks after conception  a pregnancy test may sometimes show a false negative result
11877,too soon to test conception  as defined by the generation of a fertilized ovum  occurs within day or so of the sex however  it takes about two weeks for the embryo to make enough hcg to produce a positive pregnancy test blood test may be done a day after a missed period home pregnancy tests should be done 45 days after the missed period
11878,very unlikely depoprovera is a very reliable method depoprovera failures are very rare you could always take a home pregnancy test to reassure your self
11879,period can cause cramping  and dark blood is normal obviously metformin is helping you to get your period take advil over the counter for cramps
11880,what are your goals pcos causes irregular periods so being late is not a surprise if you want to have regular periods then schedule a visit to get on birth control if you are trying to get pregnant schedule a visit to discuss your options
11881,yes if you have not had your period  you can certainly be pregnant  despite having a diagnosis of polycystic ovaries you should do a pregnancy test
11882,yes it is possible so a pregnancy tests would be wise but you really need evaluation of the uterus to make sure there is no precancer building up by missing all those periods the longer your periods are irregular especially with pcos the high the chance of precancer and cancer over time
11883,odds dont matter hi odds matter in populations  but in individuals  they dont if you have the condition  it doesnt matter if yore one in two or one in a millionyove got it metformin increases ovulation in pcos if yove had unprotected intercourse and missed a period  yore pregnant until proven otherwise ergo  get tested good luck
11884,see a doctor please discuss this issue of sex causing burning sensation to your doctor you will need to be checked for vaginal infections like bacterial vaginosis some women who have prolonged bleeding days and therefore use a lot of tampons will have dryness and sex may hurt stop your tampons and use sanitary napkins for a few cycles to see if it helps also  treating an infection will also help good luc
11885,possibly dont know when your last depo shot was most women are able to ovulate 4 to 6 months after last depo shot
11886,repeat home test in 1 week> usually not pregnant if this is your regular cycle
11887,retest even a faint positive on the urine pregnancy test is enough to confirm a pregnancy however  your history suggests that you may have conceived hence the positive test and miscarried with the subsequent negative test you should repeat the pregnancy test  if it is clearly negative then you are not pregnant
11888,swab tests waiting 1 and1 2 hours is sufficient time
11889,no problem  test ok this shouldnt be a problem when these tests were first studied  the manufacturers typically tested only persons who had not urinated for 12 hr therefore  official advice is that test performance isnt known after more recent voiding but in the real world  clinics and std specialists dont pay any attention  and all evidence is the test is equally valid no matter how long so no worries
11890,if you engaged in high risk sex  you can test now
11891,48 hrs test generally takes 48 hours when they notify you depends on the doctor call his her office if no call by 72 hours
11892,yes  yes  depending on the type of sexually transmitted disease an example is chlamydia which can be silent while doing damage for long periods
11893,possibly you need to get a vaginal culture for std and a urine culture to see if you have a bladder infection
11894,vaginal stds i believe the varying vaginal level of acid which is constantly changing has no correlation to any std that is common i am not sure what prompts this question
11895,vaginal ph levels considered normal between 3 8 and 45 lower ph levels can be with yeast infections  but they can occur at a normal ph level
11896,not enough info to know if you have a change in color  texture  odor or amount of vaginal discharge  problems such as pain  itching burning with urination or sex or redness swelling then it is best to see your gynecologist for evaluation  accurate assessment
11897,intercourse is safe
11898,24 weeks most modern tests can usually detect at the 23 week period  but will be most sensitive if you wait until 4 weeks after exposure
11899,nonspecific urethritis is the name of the problem if is basically any infection in the urethra except those caused by gonorrhoea and chlamydia responds well to antibiotic treatment however  the condition may take longer to cure in some people and recur in others a 1021 day course of antibiotics such as tetracycline or doxycycline is the recommended treatment
11900,low your symptoms do not raise lymphoma as a very high probability even w  many  they have other causes too consider cbt pscyhotherapy to learn how to deal w  medical anxiety its not easy to find balance between ignoring symptoms and being captive to them but it is possible and will help heres some info: http:  lymphomaaboutcom od symptoms tp warningsignshtm have an exam and relax
11901,probably not within normal cbc and negative ct scans  lymphoma is fairly unlikely however  there is a long list of other conditions that can cause night sweats including anxiety over treatment of hypothyroidism  infections  and many medications including pain medication and antidepressants which can affect your thermoregulatory center if not medication induced  continues  see your doctor for further tests
11902,not worth worry it could be the warm weather so set your thermostat a degree or two lower and see if it resolves it unless you have fever  night sweats may not mean anything serious
11903,see endocrinologist have a full battery of thyroid tests done as well as adrenal gland tests and cortisol levels
11904,second opinion if your doctor isnt listening to your concerns it may be time for a second opinion
11905,lymphadenopathy this could be one or more of a dozen things  including ebv mononucleosis or several mononucleosislike illnesses such as toxoplasmosis  cmv infection  tuberculosis  to say nothing of the potential for malignancies  although less likely other noninfectious entities may include sarcoid  autoimmune diseases  and so on and so on this must be evaluated by an astute clinician see your pcp
11906,see ent hi there  its definitely a good sign that your cbc is normal have the night sweats  hair loss  and and joint pain timing coincided with the enlarged lymph nodes a physical exam is in order since the texture of the nodes is important if this persists  it might be worth repeating some lab work as well as an ultrasound or mri of the area could be helpful wish you the best
11907,systemic disease this cannot be diagnosed over the internet it sounds as if you are in the process of having an extensive evaluation and would continue with this it requires a stepwise analysis of each and every finding to finally arrive at a specific explanation for the problems this could be a primary blood disorder or an infection or both good luck and best wishes
11908,anxiety neurosis try to rule out hypermetabolic states like hyperthyroidism aside from anxiety neurosis pls see md
11909,potentially although i am not sure what lake ths sug means  anxiety can result in many different symptoms this would need to be a diagnosis only after excluding other medical causes though just because the cmp and cbc were normal  it does not mean nothing could be wrong please talk with your doctor to ensure thorough evaluation has been completed then  see a psychiatrist for further evaluation
11910,see a neurologist there could be several potential causes for your troubles and they may not be related to ms i strongly recommend an appointment with a neurologist to get to the cause
11911,see your pcp for consultation  tests  imaging and treatment options
11912,see your pcp you need to see your pcp now it sounds to me like you have an infection in your bowels or bladder
11913,not usually mvp doesnt cause the heart to enlarge  but mitral regurgitation which accompanies mvp does and if it has  should be carefully evaluated for possible mitral valve repair with echocardiography be sure to keep your bp well controlled
11914,not likely once the heart is enlarged from a long standing problem  it will not go back to normal architecture though it may well continue to function normally if the enlargement is not significant sometimes  when the enlargement happens rapidly due to an acute issue  the size can go back to normal
11915,likely unrelated unrelated treat the high bp follow fibroid size and menses
11916,preop people with this combination can have surgery depending on the specifics of their particular situation your doctor and the potential surgeon are best positioned to judge your potential risk
11917,check it normal hr varies from 60100 normal bp 120 80 below140 83 range
11918,daily eggs data doesnt prove one way or the other the reasonable course is to follow a mediterranean diet and keep egg intake to a couple of times a week
11919,symptoms if your symptoms are scary  its worth while getting checked out
11920,rarely it is exceptionally rare but has been reported ive been in practice as a cardiologist for >35 years and have never seen a single case
11921,yes good indication its time for surgery
11922,see your doctor there are several options for treatment including physical therapy  pessary  and surgery you should discuss your situation with your gynecologist to come up with the best approach for your specific problem
11923,see md see a primary care physician for evaluation and treatment there are many options to treat high blood pressure  depending on the cause of it
11924,tingling sensation those may be symptoms of diabetes  see you doctor
11925,could be diabetes see md  have lab checked
11926,sebaceous cysts some women get sebaceous cysts  small lumps of fat tissue  or epidermal inclusion cysts  small lumps of skin tissue  under the skin these usually need no treatment see your provider for clarification
11927,pimples pimples on your butt may be due to impetigo or an infection of the skin apply an antibiotic oinment to them and op squeezing them because you are spreading them
11928,it could possibly be folliculitis  which is inflammation of the hair roots this is a common problem and usually abates on its own sometimes antibiotics are necessary if the lesions increase in size  become painful or don`t resolve  see a doctor for a proper examination
11929,several possibilitie this could indicate several things there are several types of eczemalike conditions that can cause this  and can affect the outter vagina other possibilities include ingrown hairs and some sexually transmitted infections your doctor should be able to tell you more with a quick exam
11930,bumps on labia what it sounds like you are describing is folliculitis however  without seeing it  it is hard to say if you shave or have waxing done  this is a common problem you should get to your doctor soon to be sure of the diagnosis ad receive proper treatment
11931,dyshidrotic eczema try benadryl or claritin for itching and vaseline ointment with cotton gloves over the hands and socks on the feet overnight may need to see your dr  if this doesnt help heres a link with information about it: http:  wwwnlmnihgov medlineplus ency article 000832htm
11932,dry skin try putting moisturizer on these areas
11933,rash it is difficult to know for sure without more history and without seeing the rash  but may be a type of virus or wart called molluscum contagiosum let your doctor have a look it does go away with time so most doctors leave it alone all the best
11934,most likely not herpes usually is a bunch of blisters very painful this could be a hair bump but to make accurate dx it needs to be looked at by a doctor
11935,lesion rashes and lesions are impossible to diagnose over the computer but guesses would include small abscess  folliculitis  insect bite  boil  furuncle  pimple  etc
11936,many things without an exam we would be able to give you an answer benign cysts  folliculitis  pimples  warts  skin tags are some of the more common findings
11937,see a dermatologist it is impossible to offer specific advice without being able to visualize the rash see a dermatologist for the proper diagnosis and treatment
11938,probably radiographs are not a crystal ball  they dont disclose everything did your dentist check to see if the tooth was vital alive swelling may be from a periodontal issue  so yes  in that case root canal may not be needed more info necessary to make a proper diagnosis have your dentist reexamine you or refer you to an endodontist if s he cant determine the cause of your swelling
11939,rct needed the presence or absence of pain does not necessarily indicate the need for rct one can require rct on a tooth even though an xray does not substantiate the need the bottom line: the need for rct may require a number of tests  observations and history of symptoms and cannot be determined over the internet see your own dentist or an endodontist to determine whether or not it is indicated
11940,yes you may have developed a sinus infection you probably need to be seen and possibly get antibiotics thanks for trusting healthtap
11941,return return to the dentist who treated you for immediate follow up follow all of the post surgery instructions
11942,recurring ulcer any sore or lesion in the mouth that does not heal in 1014 days  or is recurring  needs to be examined and possibly biopsied if your dentist is unsure why you are have a lesion  have the root canal evaluated by an endodontist if the root canal is sound  and no other teeth are involved  see an oral surgeon or periodontist for an exam
11943, drinking what and how much of it
11944,cheek and tongue hello  it is uncommon to see a tooth infection cause a lump inside your tongue i would recommend a trip to your family doctor for an evaluation and possible referral to an ent doctor
11945,it could an infection can cause an abscess  the lump can be due to a fistula where pus come out best way is to take xray  check with your dentist
11946,after oral occasionally  std tests will not be positive because they are performed too soon after exposure i would repeat the tests also  think about other entities that are not stds that can cause throat and mouth ulcers such as coxackie virus
11947,flu seasonal flu is very common viral infection with symptoms you have described usually the condition resolves on its own with home care drink water and get a good rest nsaids eg aleve are also recommended every 6 hours if concerned  see your pcp after 6 days or so take this opportunity and quit smoking
11948,could be few more viruses which can cause blisters in your throat treatment usually symptomatic
11949,dry socket may be a dry socket see surgeon
11950,see a dermatologist without more information  its hard to guide you sometimes blisters on the lips can be mistaken for other problems and blamed on hsv hsv viral life cycle is 14 days if yore currently taking antivirals  then 9 weeks is a long time to still have a blister hsv is most contagious when blisters are present id be concerned that the problem is worse than hsv and consult a dermatologist asap
11951,low risk by being on valtrex and using condoms  yore greatly lowering the risk you cant do much more than that short of abstinence keep in mind that he could already have been infected  even if he has no outbreaks the only way to find out would be with an hsv2 antibody test but since yore already taking valtrex  im not sure the information would help
11952,yes risk there will always be a risk this risk will be less if you do not have an outbreak during sex and if you use condoms the condoms is the most important part but this is not 100% protective
11953,still contagious even it has scabbed over  the herpes virus can always be contagious  although it is most contagious immediately before an active outbreak of blisters less contagious if it is scabbed comparing to blisters
11954,no once it is scabbed over you should not be contagious
11955,yes most of these are hsv1 and most adults already have it without any symptoms so whoever you kiss either already has it or will get it anyway you shed viruses periodically so you might transmit it between attacks  though you are most contagious at the beginning of a sore fish oil is of absolutely no value for this there is no detox of herpes there is a prescription pill which is very effective
11956,yeast infection what you describe is not unusual
11957,need tests most common cause for bumps these days is herpes please get a culture from bumps done for herpes also a blood test for herpes antibodies in blood you may also take a cource of valtrex   which may help you
11958,needs evaluation genital bumps can be a std such as warts hpv or molluscum or other lesion evalution by your provider gyn will help determine what the proper diagnosis and treatment is
11959,ok to kiss slightly contagious when no sore is present relax most people already have it without any symptoms so the person you kiss already has it or will get it anyway do not kiss kids with active eczema or people with diseases of disordered immunity the color will soon be normal valacyclovir and acyclovir prescription pills are very effective to treat or prevent attacks attacks may come from sun
11960,not contagious the redness could be something called postinflammatory hyperpigmentation which is normal after such a lesion not contagious at this point
11961,see a doctor depending on how you injured your wrist you may have broken a bone in your wrist  or torn a ligament the popping and grinding is not normal if the wrist is tender at all i would definitely get an xray untreated wrist injuries can lead to painful arthritic changes down the road
11962,no 2 ways to treat this take a pill every day for years to prevent attacks take a dose at the first tingling which preceeds an attack 1 or 2 doses only  not effective unless taken immediatly at first symptoms if it is the very first acute infection  the take for 10 days if you have shingles a different virus take for 7 days
11963,herpes simplex probably not  unless your doctor intends to prophylax you against future outbreaks talk to them and find out why
11964,probably not if you dont have any open sores or fever  id say no
11965,it can azithromycin can cause hepatotoxicity  which it is liver toxicity and that can cause jaundice and that can cause yellow sclera and yellow eyes
11966,strep throat strep throat should be diagnosed by rapid strep test and or throat culture azithro is acceptable alternative if allergic to penicillins short course of azithro is generally fine when taken with other medications  however  there may be some specific drug interactions you should check with pharmacist if you have specific concerns
11967,treating chlamydia yes  in the scenario you describe you had a sexual encounter when one or both of you were not fully treated i often advise my patients that it takes at least 48 hours to be free of contagion after being treated for chlamydia or gonorrhea i would also hope that your health care provider treated you for bothwhich is the best approach to these two infections
11968,very effective azithromycin is very effective for chlamydia be sure not to have sex for at least one week after taking the treatment your sexual partner most likely will need the treatment also good luck
11969,no 800 mg of advil can be taken a total of 4 times during a day to equal a max of 3 200mg for an adult
11970,likely if she was your only sexual contact then she probably was the source of your chlamydia that is the way it happens
11971,when when a person is exposed to chlamydia  symptoms typically begin to present 1 to 3 weeks following exposure it is possible this partner gave it to you  however  it is also possible that a partner within 3 weeks could have passed it to you it will be crucial for you to let your sexual partners know if you believe they may have been infected do the right thing and let them know to prevent further spread of the std and also because a chlamydia infection that goes untreated can have terrible effects on the reproductive organs
11972,azithromycin consuming alcohol while on antibiotic course is not advisable
11973,alcohol wait another day drink responsibly
11974,bronchitis may need to give the infection and residual inflammation more time to clear from the lungs
11975,not necessarily it would be unusual for you not to be congested  and you simply may not be aware of it because the pain is overwhelming some sensations use a nasal saline rinse with a netipot and a decongestant if you have fever or the headaches worsen  have nausea  sensitivity to light or difficulty moving your neck see a doctor asap go to er do not wait
11976,ask provider please contact the provider that prescribed the azithromycin this question
11977,if if after 2 weeks without any other symptoms you have not improved  you may want to look into other reasons for your laryngitis there are number functional and anatomical problems that can cause prolonged laryngitis such as:  otherwise silent reflux related changes   vocal fold hemorrhage broken blood vessels   muscle tension dysphonia   benign or malignant growths especially if you are a smoker these can be diagnosed via a laryngoscopic exam performed by an otolaryngologist otherwise known as an ear nose and throat doctor if your laryngitis persists  you may want to have your doctor recommend a specialist who has the tools to complete a more thorough exam good luck
11978,did you have cough if you had cough and congestion as well as developing laryngitis  most cases are caused by a virus  and many colleges are advocating not giving antibiotics  because they will have no effect dextromethorphanin in mucinex dm may cause side effects  and the guaifenesin is no better than a placebo if you had uri symptoms  a short course of prednisone will bring your voice back quickly
11979,engorgement of tissu appears to be the engorgement enlargement of small areas of breast tissue as it is closer to the surface near the nipple you are able to feel if related to the menstrual cycle indicates the swelling localized island of breast tissue in response to hormonal factors of menstrual cycle this is nothing to worry hot compresses  warm soaks may help to reduce pain  if very painful
11980,inflamed follicle sounds like an inflamed follicle which is now resolved if it returns  see a doc
11981,see a doc good for you for paying attention to your breasts lumps are common  especially in young women who are having periods and breast cancer is very rare in women under age 35 still  any breast changes need to be evaluated by a doctor this includes the lump and the sinking in part im really proud of you for paying careful attention to your body dont be worried  but do get checked
11982,please please see a doctor for an proper evaluation all breast lumps need to be taken seriously most are not a danger but there is always a risk of cancer
11983,breast lump at 13 one sided breast lumps at 13 is probably just a fluid filled cyst and is not of great concern it will probably disappear in another month or two this is a time of rapid change in breast tissue  and cysts are common unless your family history is strongly positive for breast disease  it is most likely not serious see your doctor if it enlarges or if there is discharge from nipple area
11984,cant diagnose but a breast lump that has been present for over a year warrants medical evaluation take care
11985,unlikely most probably   after breast biopsy patient has focal hemorrhage and small area of fat necrosis  as previous site of biopsy breast tissue predominantly fatty and does not reveal large blood vessels and ussually no hematomas after biopsy a hematoma or haematoma  is a localized collection of blood outside the blood vessels  usually in liquid form within the tissue
11986,fibroadenoma near ducts nipple commonly bleed cannot be sure it is fibroadenoma even with two priors needs excision
11987,cyst that is a common area for a fluid filled cyst to occur  usually in one of the the tendons of the posterior knee  also known as a baker cyst should be looked at by md and evaluated 
11988,lump a lot more information is needed to answer this question  is it painful how long has it been there is it mobile has it grown in size if so how rapidly you should have it checked out by a local dermatologist or yor primary care doctor
11989,get it checked soon do not spend any more time wondering what you describe is potentially concerning for cancer hopefully it will be something less serious  and more likely it will be less serious  but do not delay getting it checked
11990,you need a physical a physical examination by your doctor is necessary for you to do right away from what you described  it could be breast cancer but only a medical exam can help you sort this out so do not delay seeking medical consultation asap
11991,normal tissue thelarche is the term used for the emergence of breast tissue in the beginning stages of puberty a spongy bit of true breast tissue is located directly under the nipple on one or both sides it can be tender to touch  one side may emerge weeks before the otheryour pcp can confirm this process  i hav at least 35  yr come to my office for the same question
11992,probably not sounds like an benign breast bud many children experience before puberty if you are concerned  then a visit to her doctor will help further define it and let you know what to expect
11993,highly unlikely it still can be a viral infection take your meds as prescribed  stay well hydrated
11994,yes no yes recurrent canker sores can be part of allergies no sickness is normal resp allergies are usually caused by inhalant allergy like dust molds pollens recurrent canker sore can be associated with food allergy we propose that you treat the cause so that you do not suffer unnecessarily please visit us at wwwehacstlcom to learn more about treating the cause of illness
11995,it can be strepto coccus infection i e strep throat  or a very bad viral infection but the possibility of strep throat needs to be ruled out because it needs to be treated otherwise it can lead to a lot of infections and complications not to mention death from overwhelming streptococcal infection
11996,poss canker sore if it has recently surfaced it could be an apthous ulcercanker sore in that location they can be quite painful if it lasts greater that 10 days have a dentist look at it
11997,needs to be seen it could be any number of things or a combination of issues see your physician to have it checked out situations such as these require one on one clinical evaluations
11998,see a doctor could be viral respiratory infection or sinusitis
11999,herpangina usually viral tonsillitis herpangina  mono  herpes stomatitis which usually resolves but takes forever bacterial causes are strep throat etc quick visit and testing should pinpoint the culprit  in the meantime lemon  honey gargle works great regards
12000,infection likely strep infection in the tonsil resulting in cervical lymph node enlargement ent evaluation and antibiotics would be helpful cancer unlikely
12001,most likely ebv if you have sore throat for few days of ln swelling it is probalby viral  if the condition continues for more than 2 weeks then need testing
12002,can be seek immediate medical attention as this can be an abscess in your throat or the back of your tonsils we can be lifethreatening
12003,might just be ulcer are you referring to your maxillary wisdom tooth if it is erupting towards your cheek  then when yore closing your mouth  your pinching the mucosa between the tooth and the bone have that tooth taken out asap as it continues to grow  you will no longer be able to close your mouth because of the pain ive seen it so many times
12004,saline rinse  gel to treat your current problem  saline rinses and oral gel for canker sores from pharmacy see oral surgeon for assessment of wisdom tooth including discussion of extraction
12005,no the tonsils are subject to a great deal of inflammation under certaincirdcumstances where there are the occassional cases of malignancy developing it is either from squamous malignancy or lymphoma neither present as hemmorhagic areas the latter can occur when there is some bleeding into the tonsil because of proximity to the underlying intermal caroltid artery warm gargles should help
12006,kidney infection  also called pyelonephritis  often causes pain in the abdomen  particularly in the flanks this is where the kidneys are located  and the inflammation around the infection sites frequently causes discomfort it does not cause a pulled stomach muscle  although the pain with pyelonephritis may feel like that at times as the antiobitics begin to work  you should notice the pain improving
12007,yes you can it is possible to have a repair of the repairs acl as for arthritis that is another matter perhaps a second opinion will help there are options that an orthopedic surgeon can give talk to your doctor im sure theres options
12008,need more info i would need more information to form an opinion: what imaging study was done where is the stone what size if it is 5 mm or less  it will pass but there will be pain larger size frequently needs interventionyour doctor should be following you or referring you to a urologist best wishes
12009,kidney stone it really depends on the size and location of the kidney stone smaller stones < 4 mm have a greater than 50% chance of passing however if the stone is in the kidney it makes it more difficult to predict when it will pass
12010,vicodin all medications have risk it would be a low risk provided you use it as directed by your doctor one may argue that you should be able to get away with a milder analgesic like tramadol or tylenol  codeine
12011,see doctor most sore throats and colds are caused by viruses which do not respond to antibiotics but sometimes they are caused by bacterial infections ie: strep throat  staph infections which need to be treated with antibiotics the doctor can take a throat culture which will help to identify if you have a bacterial infection and require antibiotics
12012,ask your md urine test is quick and easy
12013,get tested if you have symptoms of an std  or have had unprotected sex  you should get tested  sooner rather than later if you have symptoms  you should avoid sexual contact intercourse of any type until you are tested and or treated appropriately if you do have a positive test for any std  also make sure any of your partners are tested and treated as well
12014,allergic vaginitis eliminate soaps  baths  laundry detergents  etc
12015,oh my gosh  couldnt that cause pain rather than douching  would encourage you to treat the infection instead
12016,correct diagnosis adolescents do not have ddd they may have mri findings of this  but generally speaking  ddd is extremely unusual in this age group i would be more suspicious of scheuermanns disease may be present without spinal deformity  but mri findings will show multiple degenerative discs  spinal stenosis  herniated discs  etc i would invest some time and find a doc that will pursue the right dx
12017,18 y o w  3 yrs mbp it certainly could be muscle spasms  but after 3 years  need to look at why your back is staying in spasms is it a structural problem bad ergonomics or posture congenital acquired sport related etc detailed history  physical exam  xray and mri would answer many of these questions core strengthening of your midsection thoracolumbarabdominal muscles is likely to help good luck
12018,yes for er+ cancer yes  for early stage er + breast cancer  the therapy would include surgical resection  mastectomy or lumpectomy followed by radiation then followed by either chemo followed by or estrogen supression therapy  like tamoxifen  or aromatase inhibitor ai  tamoxifen can be started first then switch to ai  femara etc   or can be started on ai in the very beginning  for postmenopausal women
12019,see below tamoxifen can be used after other treaments such as surgery  radiation and chemotherapy to prevent a cancer recurrence  or it can be used if cancer has spread in order to slow its growth
12020,chemotherapy tamoxifen is a very effective drug for the treatment of hormonesensitive estrogen receptor + breast cancers it may be used alone or in combination with traditional iv chemotherapy  depending on the cancer stage furthermore  tamoxifen has been shown to be effective reducing the chance of developing breast cancer in highrisk women chemoprevention
12021,small risk tamoxifen is asociated with a small less than 5% risk of uterine cancers  women on tamoxifen require regular gynecologic checkups every 612 months and highrisk women may need ultrasound screeenings too
12022,possible but rare uterine wall thickening is a known side effect of tam it usually presents as abnormal spotting or bleeding definitive dx is via endometrial biopsy if ignored it can progress to uterine cancer this is usually cured with hysterectomy alone
12023,soy is fine in mod we dont have great data on the effects of soy and phytoestrogens on breast cancer we believe that they act like weak estrogens and may mimic the effects of tamoxifen thus reducing risk but in high doses could have negative effects so it should be safe to eat some soy but avoid large amounts  like in supplements or shakes  etc
12024,avoid it is better to avoid any soy concentrates or its products in u r situation  
12025,most likely normal mirena wont stop your ovaries from going through its normal production of estrogen and progesterone even though there is no period sometimes the normal hormonal changes can give you the symptoms as well it is common to have occasional bleeding through the mirena
12026,unlikely some patients will have aches and tingling at the hair roots after chemotherapy a headache is typically related to something else
12027,dont stop now the purpose of all the treatment is to reduce your risk of recurrence you are fortunate to have a chance at cure if it recurs it is deadly the hardest part is behind you chemotherapy yet the most important treatment   that lowers your risk the most  is whats left talk to your doctors and counselors good luck
12028,half way you are half way done  need radiation after lumpectomy for sure if cancer was estrogen  progesterone receptors er pr positive  you need tamoxifen for added protection to block it from coming back
12029,keep going congrats for finishing chemo please do not stop now if you had a lumpectomy  then you need to get radiation to help decrease your chance of the cancer coming back in the lumpectony area if you skip rad  you recurrence rate is 30% if you do not want to get the rad  then you should get a mastectomy the rad is not as bad as chemo and only takes 78 weeks good luck
12030,keep it up you must feel understandably tired and worn out after chemo but  since you had a lumpectomy and i assume your cancer was er+ it would be unwise not to complete the recommended treatment dont be overwhelmed by this take it one day at a time
12031,not rare depending on the chemo permanent or temporary loss of ovarian function is a common side effect of chemo some patients have no periods for more than a year and then restart them  others end up with early menopause you are still young so its possible they will restart even if they dont  your ovaries may still be working to some degree
12032,low  but not zero first of all  congratulations on being a 20yr survivor it is impossible to give you a number or even a range without knowing more specifics about your cancer  however  the fact that it hasnt returned in 20 years certainly puts you in favorable statistical category i suggest that you meet with your medical oncologist to discuss this  as well as any measures you can take to prevent a recurrence
12033,very low  but sounds that you have been truly blessed with your life  and the chance is very low for the cancer to return but not impossible sometimes a different breast cancer could develop  even the kind could change its characteristics like hormone statustypically  that would have happened soonerthe incidence of breast cancer in a woman goes up as she agesyou need to keep your ck ups  exams good luck
12034,yes tamoxifen is only useful in breast cancers which are estrogen receptor positiveer+ so tamoxifen is of no use if the tumor is er negative check your tumors hormone receptor status and you will have the answer to your question>
12035,yes tamoxifen is a very effective drug for the treatment of hormonesensitive estrogen receptor + breast cancers it may be used alone or in combination with traditional iv chemotherapy  depending on the cancer stage it has no role in rx of estrogen  breast ca furthermore  aromatase inhibitors are an effective alternative to tamoxifen for estrogen + breast cancer after menopause
12036,mucocele possibly the bump on the side of your mouth might be a mucocele it is a clear bump filled with salvia caused when the duct to a minor salivary gland gets clogged and the saliva backs up most common on the lower lip but can occur elsewhere in the mouth ussually resolve on their own some times large ones require surgical removal bumps on the back of your tongue are probably normal vallate taste buds
12037,mucocele if it is on your cheek it might be a blocked or clogged salivary gland duct and the blister is just the fluid not having a duct to let it out saee your dentist or ent to make sure
12038,depends you can have a food material partially embedded  can have localized infection of pharyngeal wall see pmd
12039,muscle spasm sounds like spasm or inflammation in the neck muscles causing the headache i would see your chiropractor for treatments and take nsaids moist heat may also help
12040,no not normal see ent doc for exam
12041,oral infection it sounds like you may have an early but possibly serious oral or dental infection see a dentist or ent specialist as soon as possible
12042,upper teeth not sure of your question  but if your upper gums are swollen  it could be a tooth masquerading as sinus or even a tooth abscess infecting your sinus you need professional care
12043,see a doctor hard to determine without a clinical exam start with your dentist or physician they may refer you to an ear  nose and throat doctor as well
12044,canker sores canker sores are often secondary to an infection somewhere else in your body  or to stress  or to eating too much spicy or acidic food it is not herpes  if someone has told you that  but it could be due to another virus  especially if you are also feeling ill you should let your doctor examine you  to make sure you dont have a significant underlying problem
12045,need biopsy a biopsy of the tongue mass is indicated in your situation first an exam with your doc and ct scan imaging of your head and neck the biopsy can often be done with needle there is a real concern for malignancy in your situation dont delay
12046,some lumps normal the hardtosee rear of the tongue has giant circumvalate papillae sheltering tastebuds a few people have a central lump of tissue on the tongue where the thyroid gland originated but it shouldnt hurt unless injured if pain persists or it grows  certainly be checked by your dentist
12047,genital lesion lumps  bumps  blisters and other skin abnormalities on the genitals need to be evaluated an examination will be needed to know the cause and treatment what you describe could be normal  a pimple  herpes  genital warts  syphilis or many other things
12048,canker sore if new  likely canker sore treat with otc meds and saline gargles if persist beyond a week see oral surgeon or ent for exam
12049,infection you still have an infection and it could be viral or bacterial a negative strep is nice but sometimes it cannot be found on the tonsils if it is in the lymph node itself your ear hurts because the pain is referred up the eustachian tube to your ear fro your throat homeopathic pulsatilla may help as may gargling with salt water your doctor may also prescribe antibiotics if it is persistent
12050,probably not the pill that turn urine orange is called pyridium or phenazopyridine which relieves urinary tract pain  burning  irritation  and discomfort  as well as urgent and frequent urination caused by urinary tract infections  surgery  injury  or examination procedures however  it is not an antibiotic it does not cure infections never seen this side effect listed
12051,makes sense there are many diff bacteria that can cause utis and the type you had was resisitant  but the culture and sensitivity that they did will tell you which type of antibiotic should work i rarely use batrim as many bacteria are now resisitant to that one i use cipro  that usually works much better and u do not ahve to take it for as many days
12052,yes please have a urine test as soon as possible  tomorrow should be fine unless you are having fever  vomiting  abdominal pain  in which case you should go now
12053,you might have persistent infection or kidney stones go back to your doctor for further evaluation it is unusual for men to get uti  and usually requires urology consultation
12054,some possibilities certainly yeast infections often occur with these symptoms and commonly occur after being treated for a uti in theory pinworms   allergy  not having fully healed up fro the yeast infection are some toerh potential causes cannot say in your particular case  however
12055,call doctor did your doctor also give you some antibiotics if still having pain  please call your doctor back and tell him her about your continued pain when urinating they have emergency call services and you could speak with the doctor on call
12056,no if you think that you have an std please see someone about that it is different from a urinary tract infection although they are in the same general area
12057,cranberry strong cranberry juice 3 to 4 cups per day plus 3 liters other fluid per day will do it evacuate your bladder frequently
12058,urinary symptoms be sure to drink 68 glasses of water daily 8 ounces of cranberry juice daily will help as well some women find that probiotics and yogurt help to avoid urinary and vaginal infections after urinating  always wipe from front to back over the counter uristat reduces urinary symptoms
12059,see below the medications will not cause any harm to the baby
12060,meds in pregnancy i would doubt that the physician would give you an antibiotic that would not be safe in pregnancy emergency room physicians usually defer to obstetricians before they give any medications for nonlife threatening situations i recommend you check with your physician
12061,see the doctor again you need to return to the doctor  burning during urination requires further work up to determine cause you may also have to see a specialist in urology
12062,need further eval it is possible that your burning with urination could be coming from your urethra  which is the tube that connects your bladder to the outside world sometimes the urethra can become irritated from bubble bath or soaps in the bathtub  or products used to clean the genital area the burning could also be from certain foods and medications i suggest asking your doctor for a referral to a urologist
12063,approx 10 days try gargling with listerine if painful use something like chlorasceptic
12064,typically 510 days
12065,see below from just before you start breaking out till you stop breaking out
12066,post tka pain the most severe pain is in the first 48 hrs it should gradually start lessening after that it depends upon how much deformity is there preop also pain is a subjective measure usually minimal pain by a month
12067,it may not be gone some are fortunate to have the surgery and shortly there after once the wounds healed  they have no pain at all many will have great improvement of pain  but never completely resolved after the replacement surgery it is a big surgical procedure with significant risks benefits  so do your research and discuss with doc thoroughly good luck to you
12068,aura varies aura are commonly visual but can involve other senses aura typically last 1030 minutes and some patients never experience this stage of migraine migraines progress through four stages  prodrome  aura  attack  postdrome aura arent the same for everyone and vary from bright flashing lights to partial vision loss aura typically occur before migraine but can occur concurrently with the pain
12069,maybe strep flu etc nose and throat symptoms can be from cold viruses  strep throat  allergies  etc  it can be difficult to tell what the cause is if symptoms only last 12 days  it was likely allergies  irritation  or a mild cold doctors have rapid 5minute tests for strep  so a primary care doctor can diagnose strep and start antibiotics right away  which means within the first 3 days of strep symptoms
12070,side effects common side effect for many medications or your getting exposure to some chemical
12071,mono not always  but it is quite frequent to have sore throat as a symptom
12072,drainage most likely you are describing drainage that can happen from an infection the drainage can be quite thick causing choking feelings
12073,sounds viral but would see your doctor for an exam and history if he she recommends  treatment or further testing it is difficult to know what you mean by blisters and furry
12074,blocked nose not allergy related need evaluation from an ear  nose   throat specialist to check for polyps or any other growth it could be trauma to your nose years back causing septal deviation now affecting how you breathe  nosebleeding is from you blowing so hard on your noseneed blood test if you have easy fatigability  easy bruising  etc to rule out blood disorders
12075,nasal lesion it is hard to tell what the cause may be however  since this is a chronic problem and occurring on one side only or mostly  see an otolaryngologist ent immediately for a more complete examination
12076,likely a sinus issue these symptoms do sound like a sinus inflammation the fact that its unilateral deserves an evaluation by an ent allergies or a sinus infection are possibilities  although both of these would usually give bilateral symptoms may have a polyp etc on one side i would take over the counter claritin daily and go see an ent specialist if it does not resolve after 3 to 5 days
12077,blocked sinus this can be an inflammation in the nose or low grade nasal infection causing blo9ckage of the sinus openings see an ent doctor
12078,epistaxis stress is unlikely to be the reason for this nose bleed it may prolong the nose bleed if associated with long standing high blood pressure  but does not cause it on its own most common cause is nose picking many local and systemic conditions can cause nose bleed if it persists  see your fp or ent
12079,epistaxis epistaxis or bloody noses can be caused by a variety of things and it is worth having it looked into by and ear  nose and throat doctor otolaryngologist they can place a scope small camera into your nose and see why you are having the nose bleeds they may even be able to stop them from happening which im sure would be a relief to you in the meantime  here are a few nose bleed tips if your nose starts to bleed  pinch the soft part of your nose below the bridge not the bridge to stop the bleeding now keep pinching for 5 minutes set a timer or look at a watch because it will feel like forever and no peeking that will stop 95% of all nosebleeds good luck legal disclaimer: i am providing this general and basic information as a public service and my response to this question does not constitute a doctorpatient relationship for any additional information  advice  or specific concerns  please speak with your own physician the information provided is current as of the date of the answer entry
12080,get examined you may have a number of possible problems abscessed tooth  so see your dentist sinus infection  see ent physician if those are not finding the problem  see neurologist there are two academies of dentists with special focus on oral pain check for members at these websites: aaoporg and aacfporg on internet
12081,sinuses  i can not say it is not your eye  without an exam but head position rarely changes things you can feel in a normal  no trauma or surgery  eye the eye is very sensitive and surrounded by sinuses i think this sounds like sinus pressure  congestion that is positional
12082,inner ear sinus you may have fluid or infection in both your inner ear and sinuses: requires an ent or medical exam for definitive diagnosis
12083,ear issues have you been evaluated for reflux consider elevating your head of bed by placing a pillow between mattress and box spring try prevecid  ranitidine to decrease gastric acid  check for h pylori a bacteria that can cause gastrits  check for food allergies like milk  gluten check for sleep apnea  tmj f u with gi  nutritionist then ent
12084,same problem i have used mucinex and it helps clear the thick mucous also  a good strenuous excercise program can help you clear all the junk in your throat
12085,see an ent doctor you need a evaluation by an ent doctor there are several conditions that can cause this mucous production including allergies  sinusitis and acid reflux into your throatlpr in someone your age  adenoids can still be enlarged and cause these problems as well a detailed history and examination will help establish the diagnosis
12086,usually usually you get a nose bleed to stop by applying pressure your allergies and your smoking might be an issue if you cant get the bleeding to stop then you might need to be treated by an ear nose throat doctor
12087,residual tonsils depends on the technique used generally  tonsilectomy removes the tonsils completes if the surgeon just debulk them or reduce them  you will see some residual tissue the residual tonsil tissue may become infected or inflamed in the future and require additional surgery if you had surgery for obstruction  then i dont expect any further problems with sleep apnea or obstruction why otologist
12088,see a provider this problem needs to be properly diagnosed and treated see a provider and check it out
12089,all related issues i would recommend first taking some naproxen aleve twice daily for a few days as these related symptoms could go away as fast as they came on if not resolved by the end of week  find an inexpensive chiropractor for a neck adjustment  but dont go overboard with treatment visits the joint chiropractor charges only $20 $30 for a treatment for further improvement  go to your primary doctor
12090,herceptin herceptin is one of targetted therapy that we can use to treat a her2 positive breast cancer there are other her 2 receptor inhibitors out there such as lapatinib  pertuzumab and hopefully tdm1 it is able to stop the cancer from growing and ultimately cause death to cancer cells that have the her2 receptors
12091,see below from a breast cancer web site: herceptin is a protein that targets and binds to the her2 protein  found on the outer surface of 25 to 30% of breast cancer cells herceptin interferes with the her2positive tumor cells  preventing their growth  and causing them to die
12092,tolerable it can be rough on some people but generally tolerable depending on the drug regimen used  some can make the hair fallout temporarily  give some figure tip  and toe numbness  and make a person weak and immune compromised for a short while but if your medical oncologist recommends it  it is because the benefits outweighs the risks of potential side effects
12093,breast ca treatment chemotherapy nowadays is way more tolerable than many years ago we do have good product to prevent side effects there are many kinds of chemo  the possible side effects will depend on the type of chemo we use chemo both as a single agent and combination of more than one kind depending on the treatment goal we also have targetted therapy as well as hormonal therapy in addition to chemo
12094,likely chemotherapy generally affects growing cells cells of the hair follicle are continuously growing and thus generally adversely affected by chemotherapy
12095,yes it depends on type of chemotherapeutic agent used
12096,likely chemotherapy generally affects growing cells cells of the hair follicle are continuously growing and thus generally adversely affected by chemotherapy
12097,yes it depends on type of chemotherapeutic agent used
12098,herceptin herceptin is a targetted therapy that inhibits her2neu receptor  herceptin has been given to patient with her2neu receptor positive breast cancer with improvement of response and survival herceptin has been also one of treatment options for her2 reeptor positive stomach cancer read mire about herceptin at wwwcancernet  wwwcancerorg  wwwnccncom
12099,very high the five year survival rate for all breast cancer is over 90% her2+ cancers used to have the worst prognosis  but herceptin changed that now they have a very good prognosis if they are caught at an early stage stage 1 or 2 the stage really determines the prognosis  so without that information i cant give you a number but i am happy for my patients with a her2+ cancer many treatments
12100,see below tamoxifen can be used after other treaments such as surgery  radiation and chemotherapy to prevent a cancer recurrence  or it can be used if cancer has spread in order to slow its growth
12101,chemotherapy tamoxifen is a very effective drug for the treatment of hormonesensitive estrogen receptor + breast cancers it may be used alone or in combination with traditional iv chemotherapy  depending on the cancer stage furthermore  tamoxifen has been shown to be effective reducing the chance of developing breast cancer in highrisk women chemoprevention
12102,nothing as good im assuming you have completed chemotherapy and are now facing the year of herceptin i strongly encourage you to take it why in the last decade  no treatment has decreased the risk of recurrence anywhere close to what herceptin offers ask your doctor for your risk of recurrence with or without herceptin if cost is an issue  even 3 doses might be enough to make the difference
12103,possibly in the adjuvant setting a hormone blocking agent such as an ai might be used that would be for hormone sensitve tumors in metastatic disease the situation can be more complicated in that case herceptin could be used as a maintaince agent other drugs such as tykerb  perjetta might fill this role if you could give more details  i can be more specific
12104,no but increase risk hormone therapy does not cause breast cancer but it does increase your risk of breast cancer according to the national nurses health study using hormone replacement therapy for 1015 yrs increases risk about 20%  if used more than 15 yrs it doubles to around 40% talk to your doctor to help you decide how to better manage postmenopausal symptoms
12105,small risk tamoxifen is asociated with a small less than 5% risk of uterine cancers  women on tamoxifen require regular gynecologic checkups every 612 months and highrisk women may need ultrasound screeenings too
12106,possible but rare uterine wall thickening is a known side effect of tam it usually presents as abnormal spotting or bleeding definitive dx is via endometrial biopsy if ignored it can progress to uterine cancer this is usually cured with hysterectomy alone
12107,yes the cause could be benign or very serious yeast  bacterial infection  atrophy  trauma  and cancer are all possibilities see your doctor for an exam
12108,yes  yes  you need to have a complete evaluation you could have a simple cause for the vaginal bleeding like atrophic tissues but you could also have a serious disorder like cancer unlikely but delayed diagnosis always makes it worse when the gynecologist does a complete hysterectomy  they usually remove the uterus and cervix sometimes the tubes and ovaries come out but we know that the ovarian hormones are helpful to most women and we often leave them behind the surgery can leave a small amount of cervix behind which could develop cancer  you could get a connection to a fallopian tube or other unusual complication in other words  you should not bleed after the surgery and the 15 years since surgery also makes me concerned the abdominal pain and fever could be from any number of conditions but the symptoms could be related to the bleeding my point is that there are many benign causes for your symptoms but there are also some serious causes like cancer that need to be diagnosed as soon as possible i do not mean to alarm you but rather to suggest that the serious conditions cannot be allowed to go undiagnosed please se a specialist and get checked for the serious problem best wishes
12109,since since you do not have a uterus  the source of bleeding needs to be determined because there is fever and abdominal pain  that is clearly suggestive that at minimum there is a functional problem recommend that you contact your doctor and be evaluated
12110,dyspepsia dyspepsia is possible as all tests are negative   may need h2 antagonist on long term basis it may help to treat as irritable bowel syndrome initially and see gi doctor
12111,possible diagnosis appendicitis  always a possible diagnosis with right lower abdominal pain if you have fever  chills  and pain persists beyond 4 hours get evaluated blood work  exam and imaging with your doc will get you to the proper diagnosis if it is appendicitis  delay is of no benefit there are several other less urgent possibilities that your doc will address  if appendicitis is ruled out good luck
12112,see your doctor symptoms and concerns like these mandate a thorough evaluation by your doctor only after such an evaluation  which may include labs and radiographic examinations  can he she let you know whats going on and how best to help you
12113,yes if you had unprotected sex you could or still can be pregnant or can have an infection  there are could be other reasons for your symptoms  you need to see doctor
12114,flu seasonal flu is very common viral infection usually the condition resolves on its own with home care drink water and get a good rest nsaids eg aleve are also recommended every 6 hours if concerned  see your pcp for evaluation and treatment
12115,possibl appendicitis i urge you to go to the er now and be evaluated my biggest concern is that you have appendicitis and may need an operation urgently before it ruptures if it has not already done so if you are to the point you cant stand walk straight  you need to have evaluation tonight log off after you read this and get your parents to take you to the emergency room now
12116,constipation abdominal pain and relief of pain after eating can occur with peptic ulcer disease however diabetes can also increase appetite  definitely constipation needs to be treated  avoidance of meat and white flour is recommended drink a lot of water and eat high fiber diet can use over the counter laxative
12117,certainly the required deep inspiration during the test may be limited by the abdominal pain if a restrictive pattern is seen  this should be suspected if you can blow out bday candles really really hard  then no problem
12118,see below i think you need a medical exam to determine cause of lump
12119,side effect the symptom you are getting is the side effect of the medicine and you may want to change the antibiotic to other medicine please contact the doctor who prescribed the antibiotic
12120,no but uneasy take medicine with some snack  use a lot of fluids  decongestant and warm saline gargles
12121,iron deficiency these lab results are highly suggestive of ferropenic anemiairon deficiency more at http:  www nlmnihgov medlineplus ency article 000584htm talk to his physician for more details about these results and previous prostate pathology
12122,ida looks like iron deficiency anemia in a 33 yo female that would very likely be due to menstruation or recent pregnancy
12123,mild hgb of 1214 is normal in a woman the lowish mcv would raise the possibility of iron deficiency
12124,no worries minutes variations of rdw and mchc on the second complete blood count are not worth your worry chances are a third one will be back to perfectly normal
12125,continue iron although your total serum iron is improving now at the lower level of the normal range for a woman  you still have some anemic parameters  which the red blood cell distribution width rdw and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration mchc both support there may be reasons for this  such as thalassemia  but since these were normal on 6 18  it is likely still due to low levels of iron
12126,you can look these all up  eg http:  en wikipediaorg wiki mean_corpuscular_hemoglobin_concentration  http:  enwikipediaorg wiki red_blood_cell_distribution_width  etc if the mcv is er nl  combined with ed mchc these could be c w some mild fe deficiency currently if reticulocyte count is elevated  this would be c w theed rdw due to an ed mix of younger  immature plus older cells these values just clues
12127,not an issue the rdw  mch and mchc are only helpful in evaluating patients with anemia ron would be unexpected to alter these numbers
12128,need evaluation all lab results need to be evaluated in the clinical context and the doctor who ordered the test is usually in the best position to do that it would also help to have the actual results of iron studies iron deficiency is a common cause of microcytic hypochromia mild thalassemia being another one if your results are improving  recovery from iron deficiency is a likely explanation
12129,anemia your results indicate anemia the cause requires identification strong possibilities from high retic count include blood cell hemolysis breakdown or blood loss from your body needs more attention as soon as possible
12130,mildly anemic numbers are consistent with quite mild anemia  likely due to iron deficiency it is hard to know for sure without iron studies and other red blood cell indices trying to encourage him to increase iron rich foods green leafy veggies  red meat  beans  lentils and taking a multivit with iron could help rechecking in 12 months should show improvement  or he may need rx for iron  or not the cause
12131,yes his blood counts are low  and it looks like there is a good chance he is iron deficient please followup with your pediatrician on what further testing might need to be done and how to return your childs blood counts back to normal
12132,your hematocrit is on the low side of normal  but overall these counts  indices and lab values seem perfectly fine to me your serum fe is on the low side of normal  your tibc is toward the high side of the normal range  making your %saturation low normal plts and wbc counts are normal the operative word here is normal a little more fe in your diet wouldnt hurt  but its not critical have a good steak
12133,no your hemoglobin is in the normal range for a woman  therefore  by definition  you are not anemic
12134,more likely acl tear injury of the knee associated with a pop at the time of injury is most often associated with an injury to the anterior cruciate ligament this injury is often associated with concurrent injuries to the menisci  which could explain the pain on the inside medial side of the knee bone bruising and injuries to to articular cartilage may also occur i strongly recommend an orthopedic evaluation
12135,tough to say i have done thousands of acls and a little pain is not scary  however if it persists  there is locking or instability  it should be checked by your suegeon
12136,see ortho if the pain is in your knee  then an orthopedist should evaluate it  you for the source of problem lower leg surgery   infection might cause pain upward  not too likely  but ortho can evaluate this as well
12137,patellar dislocation no  not normal to dislocate your patella also  the pain implies some damage to the soft tissue as well  likely medial patellofemoral ligament tearing you may also have some cartilage damage as well check with your orthopedic surgeon
12138,let me explain what kind graft was used for the acl repair  if the graft from your knee cap that it could be the reason  if is not those sign of some problem in the knee cap check it out
12139,may not be hip hip pain is usually present in the groin down the front and lateral side of the thigh down to the top of the knee you may have pyriformis syndrome or a disc if the pain goes below the knee to your lower leg and foot
12140,have to see doctor you may have sustained internal injury to knee joint  ligaments   meniscus etc    you have to see orthopedic surgeon for tests and treatment   delay may cause severe damage
12141,find a pain medicine physician who will examine you  and will make all the necessary treatment recommendations
12142,may be from spine umay be coming from spine and i will advice to get it checked by yor doctor
12143,you you have a complex problem that truly requires a comprehensive analysis of the situation giving you a simple answer would be inappropriate you may want to seek a second opinion with a board certified orthopedic surgeon
12144,cant speculate you may you may not you need to have it examined by an orthopedic surgeon your descriptions are nonspecific and vague  so i cannot guess
12145,see your doctor this is a problem that necessitates a facetoface meeting with your doctor this will allow him her to examine you  ask specific questions and possibly order tests to find out whats wrong and what to do to help you
12146,see podiatrist bumps or lumps should always be evaluated by a doctor
12147,wart it very well could be a wart see a podiatrist
12148,probably in general  the hydrocortisone is a decent itch reducer when rubbed in for about 20 to 30 seconds there are few problems that would be made worse by its use however  there are many problems for which it will not help if using  then discontinue and see doc if not helping after few days or if aggravating the problem
12149,steroid the prescription anusol should include a steroid component  hydrocortisone this is an antiinflammatory that speeds up healing
12150,see details these questions are impossible to answer without being able to visualize the rash if you are concerned  see a dermatologist
12151,topical cortisone otc hydrocortisone cream for a few days may help but your problem will not go away until you stop using the agent which has provoked the redness
12152,yes they dont interact with each other
12153,infected cyst it is probably an infected cyst a hot compress 3 times a day can help bring it to a head if it is soft and feels like there is fluid in it  you should see a dermatologist to have it opened
12154,probably yeast try keeping the area clean and dry you can try over the counter lam idol cream twice a day if it is not improving after a few days see your doctor it may take a week or so to go away if your skin touches itself there all the time try putting a cotton hanky between your legs to separate the skin and it will keep the infection from coming backyou can use hydrocortisone cream for the itch
12155,cyst it is most probably a small cyst or fibroma
12156,could be fungal try combining some lotrimin cream with hydrocortisone cream and placing that on for a month if its fungal  with it sounds like it is  then it takes that long to stop the growth then your skin gros it out thats the most likely issue gd loc
12157,meniscus tear absolutely you do not need to play sports to get a meniscus tear you can get it from squatting down awkwardly  twisting it on a stair etc if your knee is locking and painful the most likely diagnosis is a meniscus year particularly if the pain is on the inside or outside of you knee at the knee joint not the knee cap i would get your knee evaluated by an orthopaedist
12158,could be there is a condition known as discoid meniscus in which the meniscus is misshapen an mri could help diagnose most knee pain responds to exercise therapy some programs available on line sites like simplettherapycom discoid meniscus occasionally need surgery
12159,yes a meniscus tear is the most likely cause of the symptoms you describe the meniscus is probably moving from its normal position to another position which is what causes the locking and popping you will need an evaluation and probably an mri
12160,yes you can potentially have a meniscus tear with popping and not swelling  although it is certainly not the only cause of knee popping a detailed exam and an mri will usually be able to determine the cause thank you for your question
12161,unlikely if you do not experience pain  locking or instability after the pop then it is not an issue
12162,not normal  but any surgery has a side effects and pain is one of them after the knee arthroscopy it is expected to have pain up to 34 weeks however  there are many good painkillers for acute pain available please  call your surgeon for pain medication adjustment postop appointment you should not suffer
12163,acl less likely with a low energy extended straight knee injury  it is more likely you sustained a mild knee strain  meniscal tear  and or a ligament sprain mcl common  especially if tender over mcl without a significant acute effusion  an acute acl injury is less likely a simple instability exam by your pcp or orthopaedic surgeon will confirm the diagnosis see md if pain > 10 days
12164,possible landing from a height puts excess stress through the knee it could be as straight forward as a knee sprain or contusion but could also include ligament  meniscus or even fracture
12165,plantaris muscle the plantaris muscle starts just above the back of your knee and goes down to your achilles tendon at the heel it is right in the middle of your calf it doesnt stretch well if overstretched it could give symptoms similar to what you described stretching the calf muscles by letting heels drop with balls of feet on a step usually helps
12166,yes  it is possible 25% of lateral meniscus tears are missed on mri it is the job of your treating orthopedic surgeon to correlate mri findings with your symptoms sometimes surgery is recommended despite relatively negative mri findings on the other hand  your symptoms may have nothing to do with your meniscus popping and buckling are not specific to meniscus problems
12167,probably ligaments there is most likely laxity of ligaments in your knee and this can be corrected with prolotherapy without surgery visit wwwgetprolocom or wwwaaomedorg for a doctor near you that can help resolve your problem in relatively short order
12168,likely arthritis hi  arthroscopic surgery to treat meniscus tear can vary greatly from young athletes with isolated tears and older patients with arthritis at 50 yrs old you may have some arthritis in your knee and arthroscopic surgery will usually not help much with that type of pain it is reserved to help with mechanical pain such as locking and catching you will need to discuss this with your orthopedic doc
12169,get evaluated see an ortho did you have mri any arthritis any trauma swellling can be related to the way yore walking may need arthroscopy age a factor get evaluated by ortho
12170,nerve most likely have a pinched nerve need to discuss this with your doctor
12171,yes  notify your md see your ent physician  can be related or coincidence enlarged lymph nodes can be sign of infection or lymphoma or malignancy you need evaluation

12176,nodes probably not related but you should see an ent to check it out
12177,likely not related scalp patches likely not related after sinus infection ex or sore throat viral  bacterial lymph nodes may grow if they persist after a few weeks consider evaluation for ex lymphoma
12178,sounds like you might have developed an infection get to a doctor for proper treatment you might need antibiotics
12179,see your doctor could be infection inflammation  but you must see a physician for full exam and possible testing
12180,likely benign  but the neck is a very common place for mild lymph node enlargements we do about 56 lymph node biopsies a dayfrom the neckand most of them are benign however if rapid growth is noted  or if bigger than 3cm  or if other symptoms develop you need to have it checked the most common cause of enlarged lymph nodes in the neck are a viral illness  a dental infection  skin infection and other
12181,see doctor swollen lymph nodes usually represent infection or malignancy see a doctor
12182,certainly melanoma can travel anywhere in the body  no matter where it originated so  yes  a left ear melanoma can travel to lymph nodes in your neck cervical nodes on both sides  including the top supraclavicular and bottom infraclavicular areas of the collar bones
12183,yes very dangerous lesion
12184,see an ob gyn you need to be examined to be diagnosed

12190,no dosent sount like std
12191,needs visualization lumps  bumps  blisters and other skin abnormalities on the genitals need to be evaluated an examination will be needed to know the cause and treatment
12192,yes strep bacteria is a common cause of bacterial tonsillitis  however the vast majority of tonsillitis is caused by viral pathogens
12193,swollen tonsils may be due to an infection by strep or other bacteria in your case it looks like you have some pus on the tonsils called exudate however  it is good news that your strep and std tests were negative in that case it is most likely a viral infection that will clear itself if it does not improve within a week to 10 days  you should consult again with your doctor
12194,get examined many sexual partners say they are clean when they are not or they have yet to be diagnosed if your partner has had sexual contact with someone else  there is always a chance that they have an std see a doc get examined
12195,can be normal can see doc to find out what it is
12196,std does not sound like a sti  if you have burning or discharge then or unusual sore or growth then get checked out if you have unprotected sex get tests for sexually transmitted infections
12197,bumps tongue the tongue is made up of tiny little bumps that get bigger toward the back of the tongue and may get larger with illness
12198,taste buds it sounds like normal taste buds called circumvallate papillae of course  without actually seeing you we cant be sure to confirm this  you would have to see your own dentist
12199,taste buds if you are seeing non tender raised elevations  these are most likely the olfactory areas of the tongue  papillae  tastebuds these are normal epithelial anatomical projections: http:  wwwinnerbodycom image nerv12html
12200,papillae probably normal papillae
12201,bruise injury was on her arm and bruise is noted on the elbow is she able to move the elbow and shoulder well if she is not tender  moving her arm and elbow well then no need to worry occasionally bruise is not noted at the site of the injury but away from it please closely observe and get her seen if things do not improve
12202,hives thisis an allergic reaction most likely as long as she has no breathing problems or loss of blood pressure these are hives you can try bendryl but you will need to see your doctor look for exposures like a new medication  a food  now fabrices  new chemical exposures  infection = the list is very long and often we can not discover the cause we call this urticaria
12203,no worry a symptom that goes away so quickly and easily is no cause for concern
12204,rash its difficult to tell w o an exam and even then  there are many conditions that can present this way however  if it is just limited to the neck with itchiness  it may be contact dermatitis or folliculitis did you recently shave that area is there something that may have come into contact with the area recently that could have caused an allergic reaction try otc tx to see if it improves
12205,probably infection the blister may be a sign of a developing skin infection the sore may be infected also wash both with antibacterial soap such as dial and then apply neosporin do this 3 x day and seek medical care if the area becomes larger or develops into a boil  a tender swollen area of skin seek care immediately
12206,likely normal there are red bumps on the back of the tongue normally yove likely seen the vallate papillae thanks for trusting healthtap
12207,mri  and ct can lag behind the diagnosis by 2 or 3 days so doctors treat clinical symptoms  not just images depends if you are congested or not if not  then your imaging could be negative your doctor will tell you whether they are actively going to treat you for your sinuses or if you have a generalized head cold which wont show up on a ct  or mri follow your doctors advicetheir exam showed best how to treat

12210,unlikely cause stress is an unlikely cause of your symptoms which speak more for a viral upper respiratory illness
12211,sinus or iih iih may cause headaches  even if the eyes are not affected so this could be the cause sinus headaches are also a possibility these are handled differently  it would help to have more information to decide what the cause is before trying the treatment
12212,allergies you may have nasal allergies that are triggering sinus congestion and therefore headaches  you may need to see an allergist
12213,jaw back go to your dentist and have him rule out temporomandibular disease which due to lower jaw to far back can affect the ear research an article by dr costen from 1924 that discusses correction of jaw overclosure
12214,temp arteritis temporal arteritis should be entertained http:  wwwnlmnihgov medlineplus ency article 000448htm you dont really fit the age though
12215,evaluate neck if you are not improving have your doctor order a cervical spine mri many times a herniated disc in the neck can cause arm pain especially if you have not improved with the medications and physical therapy if it is a herniated disc you may need evaluation from a spine specialist to determine what other options might be needed injections  surgery  etc to help reduce pain
12216,pharyngitis most times  acute pharyngitis infection of the back of the throat are caused by viruses or bacteria symptoms of these infections include  but are not limited to: 1 sore throat  2 runny nose  3 cough  4 sinus pressure  5 otalgia ear pain  6 fever  7 fatigue  8 neck discomfort best to give it time and push the fluids if not improving then you need to see a medical provider
12217,see your dentist you need to see a dentist or oral surgeon immediately without radiographs and a physical exam  it is impossible to say what is causing this pain you could have one of the following issues: impacted wisdom tooth  infected tooth  sinus infection  fractured jaw  neuralgia  or a tumor it sounds like a tooth issue  but your dentist can help diagnosos your problem
12218,sinusitis and tmjd may be a combination of sinusitis and clenching which can affect the tmj causing discomfort

12230,what are your goals it is never dangerous to do a pregnancy test so you can do one any time after you go beyond when you really expect your period to come if you do not want to be pregnant there is a need to know sooner rather than later in order to preserve your options if you want to be pregnant then you can just act as if you are eat healthy  take prenatal vitamins and do a pregnancy test eventually

12235,sinuses amp epistaxis the inflammation caused by sinus infection  along with the pure violence of constantly blowing your nose  can lead to nosebleeds in the context of a sinus infection that being said  sinus infections tend to be bacterial  so you may be getting worse because you need an antibiotic
12236,cold symptoms if you have a significantly sore throat w swollen tonsils   lymph nodes – see your medical provider  get a strep throat test  culture saltwater gargles are very helpful mix a teaspoon of salt in 8 oz of warm water – gargle with this several times a day you can gargle with aloe vera juice a couple of times per day a mixture of chamomile tea with honey  a small amount of lemon juice is good
12237,only some things i would avoid drugs due to safety concerns but it is safe to take chicken soup ideally homemade with an organic chicken and raw honey with lemon research suggests zinc lozenges can help  this is safe in pregnancy finally  homeopathy is very safe in pregnancy and if you find the correct remedy it really helps see http:  homeopathypluscomau thecommoncoldwaystosenditpacking 
12238,could be could be mpno  or uri  or other things if symptoms have been present for more than a week  see your md
12239,uri it is clear you have an upper respiratory infection whether you have a sinus infection on top of that is a tricky question to answer in a doctors office  let alone on this forum sinusitis is usually accompanied by facial pain if yore not in pain i wouldnt think sinusitis
12240,sounds like a cold it sounds like you have a typical viral upper respiratory infection it may cause sinus symptoms feeling of pressure or fullness in the sinus area above and below eyes because the inflamed swollen tissue can block the opening of the sinuses and eustachian tube try steam or a decongestant like sudafed sometimes these infections progress to sinus infections with sinus pain and drainage
12241,sore throat you may have an adenovirus infection  but first have your doctor do a throat culture to rule out a strep throat
12242,worsening significant worsening of symptoms after you appear to be on the upswing
12243,a viral infection the sweating then chills meant that you indeed had a fever if these symptoms are recent and last no more than a week  a viral infection appears to be the most likely cause if they last beyond 10 days or are getting worse  see a doctor

12253,hemorrhoids hemorrhoids bleed you need to get surgeon to be evaluated to get treated
12254,go to doctor it is never a good idea to needle or cut yourself the biggest concern in doing so is infection the doctor would clean the skin first and use sterile instruments you also likely do not know the anatomy and could cause bleeding or damage to structures you need to have the area reevaluated by a doctor
12255,get it checked out if you have a cyst in the armpit and it is ruptured  then it may be inflamed and or infected if you are having breast tenderness now  then you need to be seen by a doctor the doctor will decide what the most appropriate treatment is for what is happening to you

12260,pregnancy test the first thing to do would be to take a pregnancy test if that is negative i would followup with a gynecologist
12261,if you are sexually active this would be a good time to take a home pregnancy test take care
12262,missed period you may have had a missed period which is a period in which you dont ovulate this confuses your reproductive hormones for this cycle  but your body usually rights itself if symptoms persist  try another pregnancy test and definitely see your doctor
12263,sex is still ok even if you think you may be pregnant or you are pregnant
12264,skippid cycle couple things could be an issue one is that you have a false negative urine pregnancy test  which does happen get a serum test blood test instead it could also be that you skipped ovulation this month and may need provera to bring your period back on since yore trying to conceive seeing a gyn would be a good idea
12265,not pregnant it is highly unlikely you are pregnant while having a period sore breasts are probably from hormone issues relating to your cycle if they continue to be sore for another week  you should see your doctor
12266,yes your symptoms are consistent with pregnancy if you already had two negative tests  wait 1 week and take another if that one is still negative  see your ob hope this helps
12267,yes what you describe certainly are symptoms of a pregnancy wait a week and do another test and repeat in several days if they a call your ob gyn i wish you the best of luck
12268,get tested the only way to know is by physical examination not very accurate initially and we cannot perform it by pc or through a pregnancy test which you can do at home and repeat it if necessary a missed period is a big clue but it also depends on how regular are you and how many days your period is missing
12269,hpt there isnt a way to know without a pregnancy test
12270,yes certainly pregnancy is a possibility take another test in no less than 4 days
12271,r o lymphadenopathy lymphadenopathy that persists longer than 8 weeks demands a full evaluation you need an exam labs ct scan of chest abd  pelvis bx of lymph node if the pathology is not diagnostic you need a radical lymph dissection to r o lymphoma vs metastatic process seek prompt evaluation from your internist and a general surgeon or ent second opinion may be warranted
12272,probable parotid lymph nodes representing primary or metastatic disease when noted in the cervical region usually appear in jugular chain anteriorly or less commonly in the posterior triangle a primary arises from oral cavity or thyroid a lesion in the preauricluar region is parotidglmost frequently any surgeon performing hn or parotid surgery can define your lesion
12273,sure yes but that does not mean that they have any relationship to each other if is an oral infection there is more of a chance that they are associated
12274,parotitis get examined asap the area you describe is a swollen parotid  salivary  gland call for an appointment asap
12275,likely an enlarged preauricular lymph node you may be developing an infection so i would keep an eye out for other evolving infection symptoms  stay hydrated  eat healthy and sleep well hopefully things will pass quickly best of luck it the hard spot continues to enlarge  becomes progressively painful  makes it difficult to swallow then seek urgent input from a doctor
12276,see your md possible infection you should see your health care provider to be checked and treated
12277,seems like a node your movable lump at the bottom of neck along with your symptoms suggest a reaction to infections but check higher up below your jawbones or behind ears if you also have small moveable lumps if these go on for longer time past your symptoms  enlarges or become harder  check in with your doctor to see if you need more testing done otherwise  a frequently seen good sign as normal reactions
12278,sounds like you might have developed an infection get to a doctor for proper treatment you might need antibiotics
12279,how long if this has been present for a few days only  that suggests an infection if present for weeks or longer  it suggests cancer either way  see a doctor
12280,swollen face you may have a protid gland swelling or a tumor need to see an ent doctor
12281,not likely cancers related to smoking usually require more tobacco than you have years in addition young people often have lymph nodes that swell when exposed to novel viruses or immune challenges problems with teeth or ears can also cause swelling this node should definitely get smaller over the next week or so if not see your doc for a thorough exam and history
12282,right pharynx absces pharyngeal abscess you need antibiotics  likely and follow up to make sure it is not retropharyngeal abscess rarely could be sore of autoimmune disease that was infected but would need labs  follow up with doc urgetn care
12283, lymph nodes these may be swollen lymphatic nodes that drain debris from the areas that were infected they may take longer to resolve if not improved within several weeks please consult with your provider
12284,depends it could be normal anatomy of the region it is true however that anatomy favors bilateral symmetry if the condition worsens or you are worried consult with an md  especially an ent otorhinolaryngologist
12285,many areas not sure where the location of the lymph node is on the back of what usually an enlarged lymph node with swelling and pain could be a sign of infection any infection in the head and neck can cause this and the sinuses is one of many areas please consult your md asap for an evaluation
12286,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs carries things too big to go into the arteries veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria viruses cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
12287,tongue possible local trauma from bite or teeth rubbing on tongue best to have it looked at by your pcp
12288,ulceration  could be a lesion on your tongue cause should be determined by your local dentist please call for an appointment
12289,reocur pimple best to see a derm or plastic to evaluate and possible excise the recurrent lesion

12291,see a doctor it sounds like you may have dislocated your knee cap patella this is fairly common in young females in particular you need to see an orthopedic surgeon or sports med doctor for evaluation and treatment
12292,let me help you i do believe you did popped your cap or you could popped a torn cartilage or loose body in the knee or many other things could cause that popping in any event this will cause the knee reaction and reaction of muscles around the knee and that will cause what are you talking about all the above need a doctor to take of it orthopedic surgeon good luck
12293,uhoh cannot say in your particular case  but generally  this is not a symptom you would expect ive never had someone be wrong on this new instability in a really recent surgery is quite an emergency
12294,it sounds like infectionsee your gyn for an exam  diagnosis  and treatment
12295,see details see a rheumatologist to learn your specific treatment options
12296,see details the is really no such thing as psoriasis with features of lupus however  with proper medical treatment the prognosis is very good as long as significant damage has not already occurred
12297,try alternative med im an internist  and also practice functional medicine  so my answer will reflect both practices moderate severe arthritis   and significant amount of pain rxs means smthn is not working correct diagnosis osteo vs rheumatoid arth if you have correct diagnosis and still not working  explore treatments like magnesium  fish oil  avoid processed foods salt and sugar  water  green tea
12298,knee pain talk to your doctor about referral to an orthopedic surgeon for injection of synvisc or some similar agent which can help for a few months steroid injections might also help as well as some other medications such as cymbalta which has recently been approved for pain from osteoarthritis sounds like you may eventually need total knee replacement surgery
12299,hip pain arthritis cause pain  if the pain is increasing in intensity  you may need an mri to evaluate for hip necrosis and or progression of the arthritis   you doctor will also evaluate you for possible hip replacement
12300,go to ortho doc
12301,depends on the injur it depends on the severity of the injury i generally recommend you avoid exercises that increase loading to your spine or impact activities thus  biking or elliptical machines or swimming are better than running also  no heavy weight lifting that loads your back such as squats
12302,a lot lifestyle changes are important like not smoking  weight control and regular exercise you can use medication if no contraindications like ibuprophen or naproxen  try a back support  guided exercise  activity modification if no better  then see your doctor for further evaluation and treatment exercise can include walking  elliptical and stairmaster machines to start and then increase it
12303,knee instability if buckling of the knee is the only symptom your having with or even without pain  its not a common symptom of rheumatoid arthritis buckling is usually a result of some kind of internal derangement in the knee like a meniscus tear or acl tear i think if this is the only joint yore having problems with  the diagnosis of ra is highly unlikely  especially if its just buckling or giving way
12304,pre ear lumps the lumps in from of your ears are likely preauricular  ear lymph nodes that are inflamed you may have an ear sinus  tooth infection would follow up with your doctor
12305,yes   possible but usually seen on one side   baker cysts is caused by some internal derangement inside the knee joint   like arthritis   meniscus   or ligamental injury   causing secretion of synovial fluid   almost like a ganglion cyst in the wrist   if you have arthritis rest will help you   ask your doctor and complete the tests
12306,bone pain she will need a full history and a comprehensive physical her doc should go over all body symptoms to make sure hes not missing a point this may be plain age related arthritis osteoarthritis or a more complex problem
12307,rheumatologist is the kind of dr your mother should see for detailed exam and blood work for inflammatory conditions that involve all the joints in the body
12308,orbital cellulitis one of the complications of sinus infection is orbital cellulitis orbital cellulitis results in eye ball protrusion  pain on eye movements  limited eye movements it is important that you seek medical care right away ct scan differentialtes periorbital versus orbital cellulitis it requires management with systemic antibiootic
12309,could be serious the concern here is periorbital cellulitis which is an emergency you describe severe pain and eye pushed out these are serious signs of infection and needs to be checked immediately a ct scan will help make the diagnosis usually a course of iv antibiotics will take care of the infection and prevent complication
12310,not usually but why not replenish this vital vitamin  as it is critical in numerous immunological and hormonal bodily functions  and deficiencies have been associated with numerous problems give it at least 3 months  and recheck levels at that point
12311,less need for meds it sounds like the bp meds are more effective and your bp is lower there are a couple of considerations: you may be healthier and if you have made lifestyle changes diet  weight loss  exercise this could lower your bp naturally thus the bp meds may be too much also  if there have been changes in your meds ie going from a beta blocker to ace inhibitor  the current one may be more effective
12312,both you should inform your doctors especially the neurosurgeon as you just had a cranioplasty however  i would encourage you to inform your gp and see what the gp has to say
12313,viral labyrinthitis perhaps a visit to your local ent is in order to see if anything more serious could be going on and to have your hearing tested professionally are you taking medication to control it antivert has been frequently used for that symptom and others benadryl is one otc dramamine may help
12314,sinus problem get a good ent doctor and have your sinus checked out
12315,sure at least to follow your doctors advice and get the recommended next blood test then  lets see whats found before you worry prematurely
12316,see below there are several possible reasons and this should be checked by your physician but you see this if the date is miscalculated and the pregancy is further along than calculated  also twins can cause and finally a molar pregnancy can cause this until you know i would not worrry about the latter but would go see my physician and determine what tis the cause
12317,not uncommon light bleeding during early pregnancy is not uncommon see this site for more info http:  wwwnlmnihgov medlineplus ency patientinstructions 000614htm
12318,pain the spectrum of pain you describe can either be due to acid peptic disease sucj as gastritis or ulcer or it may be associated with pancreatitis  you need to see your doctor and have an amylase and lipase done and ultrasound of the upper abdomen further testing may be needed
12319,blood pressure tough to say without an exam  but it is possible your blood pressure is getting low on occasion causing these symptoms follow up with your treating doctor and get eval on the bp issue good luck
12320,yes most likely the acl is not needed for inline activities it is needed for twisting turning changing directions the symptoms of recurring instability  like you dont trust the knee or it gives out  is the indication for surgery if the knee continues to give out over time  other structures will be damaged  like the meniscus  and the risk of arthritis increases i would suggest you see a acl surgeon
12321,there there isnt a simple answer it depends on your age and activity level a course of therapy may minimize your feeling of instability if you have episodes of giving way of your knee you are more likely to require surgery if you have arthritic changes  acl surgery is unlikely to help
12322,plan b i always recommend checking a pregnancy test about 2 weeks after plan b  but plan b also commonly causes bleeding about a week after use i would remind your partner too that ejaculating on the vagina is not recommended if you dont want to get pregnant
12323,unlikely consider better choices
12324,planb you seem to have taken plan b at the proper time  thus avoiding a possible pregnancy
12325,no problems here minor bleeding after plan b is a side effect of the hormones in the medicine as long as the bleeding is not severe and your normal period returns the following month you should be okay
12326,yes unlikely you were pregnant carry on according to schedule
12327,get a preg test there are pregnancy tests available in pharmacies  also many free clinics that will provide confidential testing and medical care you have not provided a time frame so it is difficult to tell online but there is care available   hotlines you can call  confidential care is also available at many area hospitals
12328,unsure low prob plan b is very effective  and works best when taken within the first 24hours its main dude effect is vaginal spotting or light bleeding from 57 days after use your symptoms are pretty typical of planb use if you are considered about conception  most preg tests are sensitive to detect a preg around 710 days after possible conception implantation expect your cycke around the usual time
12329,depo side effects unfortunately  this is not an uncommon side effect of the depo progesterone injections certainly speak to your gyn and advise re: bleeding  since this could possibly be due to other causes however  side effect of the injections seems to be most common
12330,nonspecific symptom its possible that you are pregnant if you had intercourse without using any contraception however  the white discharge is a nonspecific symptom and doesnt mean you are or are not pregnant best wishes
12331,slim to none if you were taking your pill regularly and did not miss any  then pregnancy is unlikely
12332,herpes simplex herpes simplex is a virus that you catch from someone who is infected with it most transmission occurs when persons shed virus but lack lesions usually skinskin  skinmucosa contact hsv is inactivated promptly at room temperature aerosol or fomitic spread unlikely infection occurs via inoculation onto susceptible mucosal surface or break in skin
12333,not contagious if it is completely healed you need not worry
12334,exam if you ruptured your ear drum and are having pain  fever  or other symptoms  you should see a doctor for an evaluation so they can look at your ear drum follow up with your pcp tomorrow
12335,possible please check with your primary care physician he should be able to make a diagnosis and prescribe appropriate treatment
12336,possibly its possible that you have a preauricular in front of the ear lymph node though this is hard to determine without better understanding any associated symptoms or the actual appearance feeling of the lump you should seek medical attention if this lump does not resolve in the upcoming weeks or gets larger or you develop other symptoms around it best of luck
12337,normal gastroenteritis usually lasts anywhere from 37 days stay hydrated glad yore feeling better
12338,acne scar some scars can be treated but most can not but visit a dermatologist or plastic surgeon for evaluation
12339,scar revision all scars can be revised  some with excellent results while others improve there are variety of treatment options for depressed or icepick scars such as microexcision with closure which will produce minimal and least noticeable scar
12340,tongue lesion many small tongue lesions can be from biting the tongue  friction on teeth or dental work  or thrusting the tongue on the palate it is still advisable to see a doctor to check the area
12341,could be call your surgeon and have them take a look
12342,possible dry sockets usually occur 35 days after surgery dry socket symptoms usually include severe throbbing pain that rdiates from the ext site to the ear  neck and head  foul taste and other teeth hurt if these are not present  the taste maybe food debris or the sutures see your surgeon
12343,did did you have the penetrating wound to your knee address to see if it got to the joint where any xrays taken you dont give enough information for a clear answer
12344,kneecap joint you may have bruised the kneecap joint  which can take 68 weeks to clear up you should see a nonsurgical sports medicine specialist  who can make an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan
12345,bump under lip see your doctor to determine what the skin lesion is as there are several possibilities appropriate treatment can then be given
12346,yoll be just fine you are experiencing pleuritic chest pain after your viral infection you can have cough and some discomfort for up to 6 weeks after the infection some people benefit from an asthma inhaler you should see your pcp if the discomfort prevents you from doing activities that are normal for you
12347,tests if the tests were done well and the results all normal then it it likely that your symptoms are not from your heart  but would review the results with your physician
12348,pain stabbing pain is unlikely to be cardiac pot could possibly be related but not common
12349,heart is fine i am very surprised that any physician would put you through such extensive and expensive testing it actually blows my mind your heart is fine have you considered working with a personal trainer expert in weight lifting to see how you are lifting and what could be done differently to prevent or avoid too much pain with your workouts and post work out recovery
12350,no u r chest pains are noncardiac
12351,chest pain the reason for the chest pain is not probably cardiac other causes like acid reflux or musculsketal chest pain that could cause it the lvh on the echo doesnt mean anything
12352,with all those negative results  it does not sound like lung or heart problem it could be esophagitis or gerd  or something else in the gi tract confer with your doctor about further treatment
12353,anxiety these are common symptoms seen with anxiety you dont have to have anxiety disorder per say  but an event or circumstance that may be causing more stress than usual sometimes the stress is internalized can manifest with shortness of breath  chest pain  and rapid heart rate try some meditation aka mindfulness and see if that helps also  follow your doctors instructions
12354,age  tests lowvalue some significant congenital =bornwith issues are not detected until 40s  if ever  while we are alive to any age at your age  stress tests very rarely of any value because typically only detect severe complications of advanced artery disease additionally  doc is doing tests commonly done  paid for  may be ok or far off target if pain from diaphragm intercostal breathing muscles  lungs  etc
12355,nothing else the last remaining concerning diagnosis in a young person with exertional chest pain is the possibility of a congenital abnormality of the coronary arteries your doctor is simply trying to evaluate for this last possibility
12356,probably not cardiac need more description of the chest pain  but  with all the above studies being normal  and considering your age  most probably your pain is of noncardiac causes  most commonly musculoskeletal also exercise induced asthma can present as chest pain with exercise a consultation with a lung specialist  or trial of bronchodilators before exercise may be helpful best to discuss w ur pediatrician
12357,chest pain and youth not necessarily at your age and still growing this is most likely muscular pain it is normal to feel this way i am not sure why anyone would have put you through all of the testing you went through if your pain subsides quickly and if you have no other symptoms then you do not need any further medical work up yet
12358,no need for now since your pcp and cardiologist   after doing the appropriate evaluation told you that your heart is fine  no need to worry about your heart chest pain can be caused from rib pain  stomach  indigestion or muscular  majority of patients that go er for chest pain is not cardiac
12359,i would not i would not take diflucan if i did not need it
12360,no fluconazole interacts with many medications and therefore should be used only to treat active infections unless a patient is immunosuppressed yogurt with active cultures or lactobacillus acidophilus supplements can help some people prevent yeast infections especially during courses of antibiotics also keep yeastprone areas dry by using zeasorb or other powders over the counter is helpful
12361,its ok high dose fluconazole should be used with caution  but single dose 150 mg are ok but the discharge from being 35 weeks pregnant can cause the same symptoms as a yeast infection make sure your doctor actually checks for yeast and doesnt treat based solely on sypmtoms
12362,not to worry most drugs are labeled category c meaning there may be hazards in non human species yeast medications have proven to be safe in pregnancy
12363,it is ok 100 mg daily for 3 days should be safe  unless you have an underline problem or sensitivity to this medication
12364,not necessarily you can take it now  but may need to repeat the dose in a week
12365,tell your doctor your health care providers need to know that you are getting yeast infections after antibiotics  specifically the pcn  so they can give you a prescription for a medication that can prevent it from happenning again some patients benefit from using otc monistat at the end of treatment with antibiotics or when they start having first signs of discomfort however  some will need prescription med
12366,probiotics if you will eat a six ounce carton of yogurt with active cultures  drink eight ounces of buttermilk or take a probiotic daily while taking your penicillin this will decrease  but not eliminate the possibility of getting a vaginal yeast infection
12367,yes benadryl and diflucan do not cause problems when taken together
12368,very common antibiotics are common disruptors of the normal vaginal ph balance  and can cause overpoliferation of candidal flora  resulting in yeast infections usually  otc treatments or or diflucan antifungal treatments are effective to resolve symptoms
12369,see doctor you then need a prescription
12370,yes by all means
12371,yes yo should not have sex during infection
12372,many causes it sounds like irritable bowel syndrome  but you should be checked by a gastroenterologist it could be a sign of much more serious problems
12373,bloody stools  bloody stool is always a worrisome sign true  your other symptoms may be functional  blood may be hemorrhoidal or from an anal fissure however  blood mixed with bowel movements raises concern for ischemia  inflammation  infection depending on age  concurrent medical problems  current medications particularly blood thinners  nsaids  aspirin  risk factorsbe concerned  please get checked
12374,many causes  no there is no blood test for irritable bowel syndrome it is a diagnosis made by excluding other serious causes of intestinal disease you should have a colonoscopy  ct scanning of the abdomen  endoscopy to rule out celiac disease  and certain blood tests to look for autoimmune disorders in many cases all of these studies will be negative  and irritable bowel syndrome will be the diagnosis goo
12375,parasympathetic parasympathetic nervous system over activity evokes colon spasm  evacuation imo a possible cause of ibs  which is a functional disorder for which there are no demonstrable tissue pathological features  blood tests  laboratory finding  or imaging studies pain arises from involuntary spasm of colon smooth muscle imo a disordered pelvic girdle explains ibs  fibromyalgia often concommitant
12376,bloody stool consult a gastroenterologist to rule out comoros or irritable bowel
12377,see your doctor anytime yore having bloody stools you should be evaluated it could be a sign of a serious infection  especially given your other symptoms dont try to handle this on your own
12378,not at all stool pattern in ibs runs the entire spectrum from loose  frequent  watery with urgency to hard  lumpy constipation with feeling incompletely evacuated sometimes patients will evolve from one extreme to the other ibs is however a diagnosis of exclusion  so what tests have you had so far to clarify this diagnosis
12379,either or other your symptoms are consistent with both irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease among others i am not sure what physical exam means and it is very important how the stool blood test is done to be accurate start taking a daily fiber supplement and drink plenty of fluid if symptoms persist you need to see a gi specialist and have at least a sigmoidoscopy or short scope
12380,needs evaluation do you have fevers or chills i would see doc for more tests to see if there was something autoimmune going on now
12381,could be as simple as taking a probiotic  but it is clear that your digestive system is in poor shape it could be ibs or gluten sensitivy you need to be checked
12382,hello hello change in bowel habitus should be medically evaluated the cause of the pain and bleeding will need to be determined before a treatment recommendation can be made
12383,urgent urgent evaluation is required as this could due to ulcer  diverticular disease  colitis  tumor  
12384,gas  bloatig this is not normal and there a many possibilities of the cause of the illness time to call your doctor and get a physical examination to determine what is wrong
12385,yes pregnancy can happen with any form of birth control including tubal ligation as there is a small chance of failure of the procedure if concerned about pregnancy check a home pregnancy test or see your gynecologist for blood pregnancy testing
12386,please see gynecolog please see your gynecologist antibiotics have been documented to cause contraceptive failure if you have been sexually active there is a risk for pregnancy despite the continuous cycle of birth control the brown discharge merits a gynecological exam please follow up
12387,possible not 100% people do get pregnant while on the pill  wait a while longer than get a pregnancy test  if this is negative do not reliey on one test repeat it a couple times a few days apart if negative c ur pcp or gyn 4 a blood test
12388,maybe any one with abnormal bleeding in the childbearing age should have a blood pregnancy test to rule out a normal or tubal pregnancy   even if pain and bleeding stop see your obgyn for evaluation
12389,yes it is always possible get a blood pregnancy test
12390,depo and pregnant if you use depoprovera as a birth control method  it works by making the endometrial lining very thin and less likely to support a pregnancy therefore  if you took it for a month and got pregnant  you could miscarry because the lining isnt thick enough to support the pregnancy therefore  the test will be positive then become negative as it runs out of endometrial support
12391,unlikely if you are taking pills correctly  the risk of pregnancy is
12392,not necessarily experiencing cramps may still be part of premenstrual symptoms which you may still experience while on birth control often these symptoms can be lessened while on birth control but they dont necessarily go away completely if you skipped some bc pills and had unprotected sex you may want to take a pregnancy test  otherwise i would consider it normal
12393,not pregnant no you are not pregnant
12394,possible if you are sexually active and your period is late   it is possible you are pregnant  even if you use contraception no method except no sex is 100% effective best to get a pregnancy test run to find out for sure if you have had sexual relations
12395,little finger numb the nerve supply to the little finger can be affected a circulation issue can also account for numbness sometimes a simple bruise or contusion or a swollen finger can also make out feel numb or different when looking for nerve compression start at the finger and work your way up tot the neck any compression on any area can cause the finger to fell different although we generally use the word numb or numbness a true numb finger has no feeling at all maybe a better word is tingling to mean only a partial difference in sensation even a swollen joint from arthritis or a bruise to the finger can make the tip f a finger feel different a swollen tendon or a trigger finger can also make the finger feel less normal a contusion or bruise to the palm can affect the digital nerves that go to the finger a site of compression can be a the wrist the ulnar nerve at the wrist more commonly affects the little finger   but some people with carpal tunnel syndrome complain of little finger numbness even though we are not supposed to be wired that way at the elbow the ulnar nerve continues up the arm and the inside of your elbow where you would think of your funny bone as residing is a site of compression that can give tingling in the little finger hoever usually little finger tingling from the ulnar nerve at the elbow will be accompanied by tingling on the top of the hand on the little finger side too finally a compressive site in the neck or at a lower cervical nerve root  the lower part of your neck or cervical spine can also give tingling as for circulation  there are a variety of systemic and localized conditions that affect circulation in the hand from ryanauds  a spasm of the blood vessels due to cold   to the decreased circulation  and neve issues of diabetes  to a disorder that is associated with trauma to the palm and interruption of normal hand circulation finally there are more severe conditions that can simulate numbness in arm of exretemities that are indirectly related to nerve or circulation issues should one who has little finger numbness need to worry about all these things and more the answer is yes and no thats for your health care provider to determine but if the numbness continues your should seek medical attention from a hand or orthopedic surgeons perspective: a lot of those who have numbness in the little finger have cubital tunnel syndrome  which is a chronic compression of the ulnar nerve  your funny bone at the elbow in the meantime think about your arm position when you are sitting at the desk or kitchen table and typing  simply sitting and being on a keyboard both your hands rotated on the keys and the inside of your elbow resting on the table or table edge can also give tingling in the little finger those who want to know more about cubital tunnel syndrome affecting the ulnar nerve can follow the link provided
12396,ulnar nerve issues one of the important nerves to the hand  the ulnar nerve  sits on the inside of the elbow  can get irritated this can happen in several ways  often because of too frequent and or vigorous bending straightening of the elbow or keeping the elbow bent for too long other causes include neck problems and irritation of the nerves in the armpit area a good history and physical  possibly a nerve test
12397,see details it is likely due to ulnar nerve compression at the elbow get it evaluated
12398,may reverse avoid all leaning on elbow  and be protective take a daily b100 complex also  try otc ibuprofen or aleve three times daily if no rapid improvement over next 1014 days  see your physician this is likely to be temporary  but hard to predict if starts worsening  such as more numbness  loss of hand strength  will need to act much faster
12399,position change need arm and hand numbness overnight is commonly caused by neck mal positioning or wrist flexion during sleep sleep collar  special pillows for supporting head  and wrist braces are easily obtained for a trial the edema should not recur with above if the problem is not resolved  your doctor can assist
12400,cubital tunnel is compression of the ulnar nerve often it feels as you hit your funny bone the ulnar nerve at the elbow if affected gives tingling little ring fingers the small intrinsic muscles of the hand and flexor tendons little and ring and the fcu a strong wrist flexor can also be affected back or chest can also be due to more proximal nerve compression neck or thoracic outlet chest pain check on
12401,cubital tunnel numbness to the fingers could be from cubital tunnel syndrome  cervical radiculopathy  neuropathy from dm thyroid issues  calcium metabolism issues check with pcp for metabolic workup of electrolytes: potassium  magnesium  calciumas well as thyroid parathyroid  c spine issues
12402,ulnar neuropathy need to discuss with your doctor  have additional testing done to assess whether there is weakness of the ulnar innervated muscles a need to determine whether you need translocation surgery
12403,maybe carpal tunnel carpal tunnel syndrome is a result of the nerve being compressed as it travels through the wrist areasee pic the symptoms often involves the thmb and index+middle finger and usually worse at night am being a diabetic does increase risk of getting carpal tunnel syndrome  but i would not say that your symptom trouble is from diabetes i suggest consulting doc for accurate diagnosis good luck
12404,see below there are no specific symptoms associated with vit d that can be readily seen on a day to day basis bone health  psoriasis  diabetes  rickets  and other diseases are associated with chronic vitamin d deficiency
12405,more carpal tunnel the most common cause of thumb numbess is carpal tunnel and since you have it on your other hand it increases the chance of you having it on the right side as well other less common possibilities include a pinched nerve in the neck and at the base of the thumb
12406,see below this is a problem that requires a facetoface meeting with your doctor in that meeting  your doctor will listen to you  perform a throrough examination and possibly order labs or other tests based on this information  he she will be able to tell you whats wrong and what to do about it
12407,need diagnosis first  if you have diabetes  that may explain bilateral ulnar nerve problems  but  if not may need to assess how this happened second  is the problem at wrist  or elbow  or even lower brachial plexus has an emg test been done  and if so  the severity may dictate the therapeutic decisions
12408,ortho evaluation go to see an orthopaedic surgeon on in your area can be found at wwwaaosorg there are ways to treat this both operatively or nonoperatively
12409,foot drop the most unstable position for your ankle is in the position you would put yourself in if you wear high heels the muscles that control and stabilize your ankle are weak therefore  it is a very bad idea to wear high heels with any weakness
12410,heels are not automatically bad for you shoes have to fit and feel comfortable  along with being appropriate for the activity you choose if you have a foot drop  assuming it is permanent  the need to be able to walk  including bearing weight on that heel  far outweighs any preconceived and often untrue notions that heels are bad
12411,ankle brace i would suggest you pick up a good quality ankle brace with laces and straps that course across the ankle in a figure eight fashion ice if swelling is noted and rest is also advised follow up with a foot and ankle specialist if the ankle is still tender after a week xray may need to be taken i hope this helps
12412,x rays you need a xrays of your ankle  leg and even low back
12413,rice rest  ice and elevate  use a compression wrap if swollen if no change in symptoms  have it looked at if there was any loss of consciousness at allsee a doctor immediately
12414,bleeding there was bleeding in the leg due to the injury if the leg gets tight or numb  see a doctor otherwise  the discoloration should clear up in 34 weeks
12415,probably not if you are able to put weight on a sprained ankle then usually it is not broken of course this is just a generalization so you should get it examined in the meantime  rest  ice  compression  elevation
12416,sprain the only way to determine a fracture for sure is to obtain xrays of the foot you may have a fracture even though you are still able to walk on it most likely  you have a sprain of the foot ice  elevate and antiinflammatories would be wise to use initially
12417,see your doctor could be many things  and should be evaluated
12418,jammed it it sounds like you jammed it and have internal swelling
12419,get a check up you may have bruised or torn ligaments in the ankle apply ice pack if the pain still persist  consult your doctor
12420,get xray i recommend you see a podiatrist who can examine you and take xrays in the office to determine if there is a broken bone fracture
12421,flexing toes if there was no injury involved  is there any medical issue you have besides limping and flexing the toes upward  do you have any other discomfort or sensation that not happen before when you limp on left leg  do you feel pain if yes where  at foot  knee or hip level i would recommend you to get it check out with the professionals for evaluation

12425,acidify  probiotics many women struggle with flares of bacterial infections related to times when the ph of the vagina goes up that is the acidity that is supposed to be at 4 blood and semen are both about 7 using a product such as rephresh once after sex and for 3 days after each period can help at the same time taking probiotics by mouth increases good bacteria in your body including the vagina lactobacilli +

12434,yeast infection it could be a yeast infection try an over the counter yeast infection preparation for vaginal yeast infections like monistat if your symptoms have not resolved by one week after treatment  then you should see your family physician or gynecologist for further evaluation
12435,hydrocortisone cream otc  would help  also cold compresses  give it time though  you will be fine  but any clue about the bug
12436,need evaluation you need to seeyour doctor to find out what is causing your symptoms it may be a sinus infection or something else  it has gone on for three weeks and not getting better  it is about time you see your doctor and get checked
12437,migraine is a serious and complex neurologic disorder headache  vertigo  visual disturbances nausea  vomiting  sensitivity to light or sound  dizziness  neck pain  stomach nose bleeding and parasthesias are common symptoms this condition must be professionally managed rec: see an orofacial pain or headache specialist for evaluation to avoid unnecessary future pain and suffering
12438,get evaluated if you have been sick that long you need to get checked today a bladder infection is the most likely cause  but there is a long list of other potentials illnesses
12439,yes mold at home or in the work place can surely cause many sxs  like the ones you mentioned
12440,see you doc this sound infectious like sinusitis that may be affecting your inner ear you will not find your answer online if you have seen a doc  go again and tell em you are not fixed if it is not looked into after that get a second opinion
12441,get evaluated you need to be evaluated call your ob or got to ld
12442,likely yes your description is likely persistent symptoms of a resolving severe sinus infection if your symptoms worsen  go see your regular doctor
12443,could be allergies persistent symptoms after antibiotic treatment could be: 1 persistent infection  perhaps the antibiotic wasnt effective 2 persistent allergies which may have caused the infection in the first place 3 persistent congestion as the inflammation of the infection clears 4 none of the above perhaps you didnt have sinusitis and the headache is due to another cause i recommend you get checked
12444,check level soon lithium can have some serious side effects especially when the level becomes too high if not done recently bring these symptoms to the treating doctors attention very soon and have your level checked to eliminate that as a cause
12445,medical problem i think this is a significant medical issue  you should see your healthcare professional to sort it all out the eye issues may clear with medical care  or adjusting your meds this is not an isolated eyecare issue
12446,pcp your pcp can help you find out whats wrong being in and out of hospitals will most likely look for causes that can threaten your life in the moment a primary care physician might be able to put all those visits  complaints together to get closer to whats going on the symptoms you are describing can be caused by physical medical conditions as well as mental conditions
12447,if you took risks  if you are aware that you do high hiv risk activities  you need to practice safety measures always  condoms  clean needles  other prophylactic devices  etc also  appropriate testing and possibly prevention drugs if you do not take risks  the chance is low  but a test may reassure you take care
12448,normal ranges fasting whole blood glucose: 95 mg dl  fasting plasma glucose: 105 mg dl
12449,your doc knows you your doctor has way more information about you than we do he is in a much better position to answer this question lots of things go into the decision besides your personal history of gestational diabetes weight  age  family history  other blood tests  you physical exam etc trust your doc or find a doc you trust
12450,your doctor knows age  weight  number of previous pregnancies  associated health problems  family history  etc these may be some of the reasons a physician might have concerns about blood sugar control please discuss this with your doctor
12451,immeidately this answer has 2 parts first  gestational diabetes may take a few weeks to improve  so follow fingerstick sugars immediately second  10% of women will be diagnosed with diabetes and 20% have elevated sugars 6 weeks after delivery  and up to 70% of women develop diabetes within 10 years formal testing should be done about 612 weeks after delivery hemoglobin a1c test  or oral tolerance test
12452,sweet future great yore checking in now about whats next agree with dr c about 612 weeks after delivery distant future no rules yet: maybe fasting sugar and a1c every 3 years minimum what you can do now: eat right whole grains  lots of fruits  veggies  1 serving only  get moving 3060 minutes a day play with your little one staying a healthy size helps keep diabetes away  your future sweet
12453,here you go the chart below shows what blood sugar usually should be during different times of the day ask your doctor or midwife what targets are right for you before eating less than 95 one hour after eating less than 130 two hours after eating less than 120
12454,depends on guideline fasting blood sugar is usually under 100 and the one hour test should usually be less than 165 depending upon whose guidelines your physician uses
12455,not sure what yore asking the limited gtt is the gold standard for detecting gestational diabetes elevated blood sugars through other testing are also potentially useful  but some sort of testing is essential
12456,very high as above
12457,pregnancy  diabetes pregnancy has way of altering glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity made worse as the pregnancy progresses you may not have gotten an f on the test but you may have gotten a d which can affect your fetus please heed your ob mds advice
12458,other factors must be in his  her mind total weight gain  babys size  family history must have your doctor concerned please ask
12459,needs confirmation a single fasting blood sugar over 125 needs confirmatory tests to diagnose diabetes this can be a second fasting blood sugar over 125  or a hemoglobin a1c test over 65% however any sugar over 300  or any sugar over 200 associated with vision change  excessive thirst or urination  or weight loss while eating more than usual is diagnostic for diabetes without a need for confirmatory testing
12460,yes  absolutely hi yes  a fasting serum glucose is easily diagnostic of diabetes there are 4 means of diagnosing diabetes: fasting serum glucose  random serum glucose  2hr glucose tolerance test  and a1c fasting glucose is an easy test  and if positive  should be repeated for confirmation eat healthily and exercise regularly keep your diabetes  blood pressure  and lipids well controlled dont smoke
12461,no long lasting some people feels nauseated  slightly sick but no long lasting effects
12462,post op instructions follow the oral and\or written instructions of the dentist who treated you call if you are unsure generally 3045 minutes and replace if necessary more than very slight oozing
12463,only one hour after one hour the gauze should be removed if bleeding persists new gauze should be placed after the bleeding subsides completely you should stop using the gauze
12464,swelling using ice 20 min on and 20 min off for the first three days after removal and sleeping at 45 degrees four firm pillows for the first three days helps prevent any swelling swelling should last about a week or less if it occurs
12465,pain swelling should be minimal unless the surgeon had to perform a surgical extraction and even then it should be moderate lasting perhaps a week or less bleeding should stop with in an hour  no real post op pain that motrin cannot handle and that discomfort may last for a day or two ie three motrin day for two days hope this helps
12466,see your surgeon if the swelling is not decreasing or getting worse you should return to the surgeon who removed your wisdom teeth
12467,go back to the surge if you are experiencing an increase in swelling or if it seems it isnt getting better after 5 days  i would recommend going back to the surgeon to let him examine the area it may be infected and need antibiotic treatment
12468,big blood clot 1 do not rinse 2 remove the clot with a dry sterile gauze pad 3 moisten a tea bag and apply gentle pressure by biting down for 45 minutes 4 repeat as necessary 5 keep your head elevated 6 limit physical activity if that doesnt work you will have to call your dentist or oral surgeon
12469,blood clot hello  bleeding following dental surgery is quite common i would recommend rinsing with cold water this will remove the clot and the cold temperatures will help to decrease further bleeding compression with a gauze will also help if bleeding persists  phone your dentist
12470,food impaction food can easily become lodged in the area where the wisdom tooth was removed if this is associated with increased ache pain  it may be a dry socket infection developing see your dentist if these symptoms dont get better
12471,wisdom tooth ext this is not unusual after an extraction  especially if there was an infection the bad taste is due to the bleeding and drainage of any residual infection make sure you follow the postop instructions given to you by your surgeon  and keep the area clean if the bad taste continues after 23 days  call your surgeon to have the area examined
12472,forever the blood clot should never fall out this is true for any blood clot anywhere in the body the blood clot will slowly change into the type of tissues needed for healing  repair in the case of a tooth extraction  it will change into new bone  gum if you lose the clot  healing with be impaired and delayed so  dont disturb it  and allow it time to heal unfortunately  it is lost sometimes
12473,ideally forever the blod clot just starts the healing process it also protects the bone from exposure to the oral environment the blod clot stays and the area heals by secondary intent
12474,heal before a meal when area is completely closed over and no opening in gums is present so food or debris can enter than eat your meat
12475,1 to 2 everybody is different one to two weeks is a good guess
12476,follow instructions i would assume that you were provided with postop instructions  written  verbal or both rinsing is usually recommended salt water  etc no straws call the office and clarify if need be
12477,normally  yes unless specifically told not to  we normally tell patients to gently rinse with warm water beginning the day after any extractions you can add salt to the water but studies are divided on whether the salt actually does anything it is normal to see a slight amount of blood in when you spit for 23 days after an extraction as well when in doubt  contact the doctor that removed the teeth
12478,it is common some degree of swelling around the mouth and sides of the face is normal after this type of surgery however  if swelling is severe or continues for more than four days after the surgery  you should call your surgeon for postop examination
12479,it can be postoperative swelling following the removal of teeth may actually increase in size for the first two to three days  and will usually reach its maximum by the third postoperative day it is not uncommon for patients to have more swelling with the removal of wisdom teeth in the lower jaw than the upper jaw
12480,chills and fever see a doctor or go to the er to make sure your chills and fever are the flu and not an infection related to your esophageal tear
12481,no its too soon to be using antiinflammatory meds after an esophageal tear tylenol is a better option to treat your viral symptoms
12482,concerned is there any chance you were put on antibiotics post surgery you almost certainly had antibiotics at time of operation and your history is worrisome for c difficile diarrhea a cause of severe loose stools as you describe regardless  you simply must be seen and diagnosed for your own safety and health please do not delay
12483,call doctor asap laura  you may have a secondary infection called c diff  which commonly presents as your describing call your doctor immediately or just go straight to their office this needs to be evaluated right away
12484,not unsual for some stomach viruses to have biphasic symptomatology symptoms occur then subside  then recur wash hands keep dishes separate hope this helps good luck
12485,doubtful it is unlikely that you will get it again  assuming this was an acute viral gastroenteritis if it recurs would definitely see a doctor and make sure this is nothing more serious than what you have described good luck and stay well
12486,dehydration you need to find something quickly you can drink and replace fluids  sprite  water  coke  ginger ale etc if symptoms worsen need to go to urgent care or er
12487,possibly 2014 – 2015 flu shots> trivalent works against 3 influenza viruses – influenza a viruses h3n2  h1n1  1 influenza b virus quadrivalent  the live attenuated influenza vaccine work against these  a second influenza b virus you might have a stomach bug
12488,rest and hydrate the key is to rest and hydrate by drinking a lot of ater and jiuces  eat yogurt and banana  and stay on liquid diet otherwise take otc medication for headachediarrhea fever or chiils nausea eat saltines crackers  and drink ginger ale take pepto bismuth if vomiting prevented you from self hydrating  then go to er  or urgent care for possible iv hydration  and stronger vomiting medication
12489,ibuprofen is not contraindicated in the presence of flu
12490,okay but ibuprofen is okay to take but it may make your stomach symptoms worse it can cause irritation to the stomach lining if you take it make sure to take it with a meal another alternative is to take an over the counter prilosec with the ibuprofen since it can protect the stomach from the harmful effects of the ibuprofen
12491,ibuprofen is not contraindicated in the presence of flu
12492,yes yes
12493,strep did your doctor do a strep swab i would also be concerned for the flu gerd is a recurrent problem
12494,more info what specific kind of brain tumor was it a glioblastoma did you see a medical oncologist some chemotherapy drugs may give you some quality of life if the tumor is sensitive to them an experimental study may be of great interest to you  depending on what kind of brain tumor you have see http:  tinyurlcom l84zx9m for details
12495,gamma knife one of the not so new options is the use of gamma knife multiple sources of radiation are focused on the lesion  thus minimizing the damage to surrounding normal tissues
12496,uncertain there is no hard evidence but it is the subject of continuing investigation
12497,not so far but i agree that so far  there is no evidence in adults however  it is not yet clear whether prolonged cellular usage for many years by youngsters will cause brain cancers the skull of children is thin and their brains are in the process of growth and development the risk is there the question therefore is yet to be answered in children
12498,depends it depends on the type of tumor because they are not all created equally if the tumor is removed with surgery and responded well to radiation  and your doctor recommends chemotherapy because that is known to work for the type of tumor you were diagnosed with  then it would be worthwhile
12499,swell irradiation can affect tumors with initial swelling from necrosis or killing tumor cells this can cause tumor to initially swell prior to shrinking
12500,yes radiation is very important to control symptoms like headaches or seizures in rare cases  surgery or gamma knife are used but only if there are only a few mets and the rest of the disease is under control
12501,yes brain metastases are often treated witih various forms of radiation if many lesion exist  whole brain radiation is used if a few are there  recent data suggest stereotactic radiosurgery radiation therapy really is useful it can allow people to live much better after they have brain metastases how your particular situation is best handled depends on many things but form most  it helps
12502,local the radiation effects should be mostly local  as it is not circulated into the whole body systemically like chemo drugs
12503,good report the radiation is targeted to the tumor site only it is localized wish you complete recovery: continue with physical therapy for gait and balance eat balanced food
12504,srs sgy wholebrainrt if they are small and few in number then either surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery may be good options if there are a large number of them or if they are greater than 4cm in size then whole brain radiation therapy would be reccomended focussed radiation can spare the toxicity associated with whole brain tx and be completed in one fraction while whole brain rt is usually given over 1015 txs
12505,radiation therapy when tumors from breast cancer go to the brain  this is metastatic disease to the brain options for treatment depend on the size and number and location surgery is an option if the brain tumor is solitary and >23 cm in size if the tumors are small radiosurgery gamma knife  cyberknife if there are more than 45 tumors  whole brain radiotherapy is used
12506,very rare can happen meningiomas can be caused by radiation but dont show up for 20 years be careful of further tests to make sure xrays are avoided if possible
12507,see prior answer in brief  anesthesia  neuromuscular blockers  surgery itself can all result in postoperative respiratory failure  with need for trach and respirator the chemo may also affect the neuromuscular junction need a careful coordinated team approach with your neurologist constantly monitoring
12508,yes you need a thorough ophthalmologic examination to establish your baseline as well as to treat anything that is apparent from your examination findings furthermore  graves disease management is a multidisciplinary approach involving usually an endocrinologist  ophthalmologist #40strabismologist  oculoplastic  general#41  and occasionally a radiation oncologist and yes  stop smoking
12509,yeast start with otc treatment and take a probiotic if its still persistent see your doctor
12510,bulging eyes i dont have a ready explanation but you must see an ophthalmologist
12511,need to see eye dr you need to have your eyes measured  to make sure they are actually protruding  beyond normal or if its just your bone structure anything that can increase what appears to be protrusion can also be tumors  masses  inflammation in the eye  or involving the optic nerve  chiasm  vein or muscles that requires imaging  and further workup also your thyroid antibody panels need to be repeated
12512,no unless you develop symptoms asymptomatic carrier of streptococcal bacteia are rare and  in fact normal healthy adults can usually handle stret infections with their immune systems without the aid of antibiotics
12513,no strep throat most often will resolve on its own without antibiotics we give antibiotics to shorten the course of the illness  prevent complications like a tonsillar abscess  and most importantly  to prevent rheumatic heart disease rheumatic heart disease is very uncommon in adults  so if you are improving on your own  there is no need for antibiotics at this point
12514,suggestion if your are doing well on this regimen and are under the care of a rheumatologist you should continue if you are not doing well  are not being tested for retinal problems then you need to see a board certified rheumatologist
12515,see details certain complex diseases are best handled by a specialist starting meds now may interfere with any additional testing the specialist may deem necessary there is no harm in waiting
12516,serotonin syndrome serotonin syndrome is rare it can occur with changes of medications doses  or with administration of a new drug which increase the level of the other medications by affecting the metabolic pathways  elimination rate  protein binding  or other pharmacological interaction consult with your doctor before taking any new medication or over the counter drugs
12517,perhaps treatment is typically reserved for deformity with symptoms pain it is hard to make an asymptomatic condition better
12518,only mri will tell but doc probably is pretty certain its a strain based on your clinical presentation otherwise he would have sent you for the mri just rest it and keep it stable if pain worsens or doesnt ameliorate  then push for the imaging
12519,consult sounds like allergy problems i would see your family doctor for an exam to make sure thats the problem and then discuss treatments available for allergies
12520,possibly breast tenderness and no menses are symptoms of pregnancy and if you have missed your period then a urine preg test would be accurate therefore if you are not pregnant then you should see your gyn doctor for further evaluation
12521,if you miss your prtiod do a pregnacy test it could be an infection or a bad abrassion from sex see a doctor and get evaluated
12522,cervicitis that surely sounds like an infection
12523,infection even with minimal symptoms  this could be an infection you should see your doctor and get cultures
12524,no ovulation bloating is a nonspecific symptom  not always related to pregnancy the negative pregnancy tests indicate pregnancy is not the reason for the symptoms irregular ovulation is what causes irregular periods and can also cause the symptoms if the symptoms persist  an evaluation by your clinician is indicated
12525,may be normal if these types of symptoms resolve with menstruation  it is related to normal homonal changes that occur during the menstrual cycle if the period does not arrive  it would be prudent to be checked for pregnancy
12526,if you are sexually active this would be a good time to take a home pregnancy test take care
12527,history pain is almost never a symptom of breast cancer if you have pain in one breast  you might have had trauma to it  or you may have an infection in it see your doctor for an examination  but give him her a full history as to when the pain started  whether you have recently had any chest trauma car accident  fall  struck by a flying object such as a ball  etc
12528,no guessing physicians do not ever guess or speculate when it comes to pregnancy ever you have asked us a question without sharing your menstrual  sexual or ovulatory history if your period does not start and you were sexual during ovulation then you should plan on doing a pregnancy test
12529,health class implantation is usually asymptomatic and would happen right after ovulation conception it would not happen this late in your cycle the previous answers were accurate
12530,tip  if your period is late  you can go ahead and take a home pregnancy test now they are inexpensive  easy to use and accurate take care
12531,probably a uri probably a virus but if it continues  you should consider an atypical pneumonia or pneumonitis which requires a z pal
12532,work up and mgt your illness most likely is due to a virus  associated with airway inflammation and reactivity which led to wheezing your shortness of breath and chest pain could be due to asthma triggered by the illness  and needs to be evaluated most bacterial lung infections do not worsen asthma  but some do  and your physician can order lung function tests and antibiotics if needed
12533,urgent care needed your symptoms could be serious sharp chest pain likely indicates an irritation of the inside of your chest surface of the lung while there are some benign causes  the shortness of breath associated with it means you need a chest xray at at minimum  today best advise would be to call your local doctor if you have one  and head to the er
12534,ike you said yes it can and it will feel exactly the way you described it  take ibuprofen 600800 mg every 6 hours with meals as long as you are not allergic to it apply heat pad on the area and avoid bras with hard wired  not better see a doctor
12535,call the doctor you should call the doctor and let him or her know
12536,pain your back and chest pain are due to a process going on in your lungs see your doctor to determine if you have an infectious process like pneumonia occuring or are you having an exacerbtion of your asthma
12537,could be a few thing you definitely need a thorough exam some of what you describe is often seen in autonomic dysfunction disorders aka dysautonomia we see this alot as a result of high stress physical or emotional a condition called pots disorder is a subtype disorder of dysautonomia a cardiologist can sometimes help  but often an autonomic dysfunction dr is needed if this is the cause
12538,bronchitis sounds like acute bronchitis  which is usually a viral infection but could also be bacterial you need a chest xray  then treatment with steroids and perhaps antibiotics
12539,congrats on stopping smoking copd and the symptoms you mention are very important please see your doc for a proper diagnosis and possible treatment peace and good health
12540,treat wheezing cough can induce wheezing but like anything in an enclosed system when there are spasms of the airways  this may also come out as cough with wheezing see your doctor and treat the wheezing and inflammation  make sure you have a diagnosis you can take a mucolytic or expectorant to make the coughing easier  but treat the wheezing  foremost
12541,md visit albuterol if there is wheezing  a bronchodilator is indicated and your physician can follow up to re evaluate viral illnesses are common triggers of wheezing
12542,its doctor time mucus with that description  chest pain and wheezy sounds need an exam and rx help it will probably clear up well  but if you ignore it  it can get even worse do it now 5 days is way long enough dont enter this demanding season feeling ill or run down best wishes
12543,muscular secondary sounds like pain radiating from the spine to the ribs   so you feel it on the sides muscle spasms are usually secondary in the spine  due to an underlying inflammatory condition
12544,pinched nerves this distribution of discomfort could be coming from pinched nerves emanating from the spine but usually the impingement would occur in the neck and radiate behind the ear and then to one side of the head pinching of a nerve in the region of the shoulder blade radiates to one shoulder as a ruleanother possibility is inflammation of muscles try nsaids like ibuprofensee your physician as needed
12545,muscle spasm this is a common complaint and could be caused by muscle spasm or a pinched nerve i would advise that you consult with an osteopathic physician or a chiropractor
12546,esophagus it is possible that you are having some esophageal dysfunction causing interscapular discomfort and reflux occasionally gall bladder problems can cause similar symptoms discuss this with your physician if symptoms persist in the meantime taking prilosec may help
12547,left arm pain hi  left arm pain is one of the various symptoms that can be associated with angina  or cardiac pain with out a history of injury  you should view this symptom as significant you should have it looked at today remember that females can have very mild symptoms with cardiac disease good luck
12548,hard to say you could have strep  tonsillitis  mono  sinus drainage  virus causing your glands  jaw to swell and hurt i would see a doctor if the symptoms are severe and not improving good luck
12549,shingles a painful  localized rash w  bumps could be due to herpes zoster shingles it could also be due to contact dermatitis stop any fragrances in soaps lotions  detergents   see your doc to find out whats causing it drug treatment for herpes zoster has recently been found to be less reliable effective than previous studies implied good scientists gone bad  again see http:  tinyurlcom k38yvsj
12550,one side or both is the rash one sided or both side if one sided you could be having shingles  that could be very painful if the rash both side  definitely is not shingles could be heat rash  or eczema  or dermatitis apply lotrisom cream but that need a prescription or you can use hydrocortisone cream from over the counter the best advise see a physician  in case you need a prescription medicine  good luck
12551,symptoms with the symptoms that you present here  i would advise seeing a physician and getting checked out sooner than later
12552,symptoms with the symptoms that you present here  i would advise seeing a physician and getting checked out sooner than later
12553,uncertain usually lumps at this age are fibroadenomas but its prudent to discuss your concerns with a physician and mother age does not preclude you from having a more serious diagnosis it might be useful to speak to your mom regarding her diagnosis and determine if there is family history of cancers which can also be useful in stratifying your risk
12554,please see your dr tendency to develop breast cancer is familial but unusual in a 23 year old other conditions can cause lumps in breasts and all need to be evaluated by gyn or breast surgeon also  the stress of knowing your mom has breast cancer and you have lumps in breasts may be relieved if you find out these lumps are benign they absolutely need an evaluation  especially because of family history
12555,maybe depends what was the cause of these problem i see very commonly patient that sustained an mva or motorcycle accident with pain in those areas that you referred could be a contusion or sprain of pectoralis muscles costochondritis could also be considered if pain in sternum rib junction reproduced with palpation
12556,not likely these symptoms are unlikely to be caused by unusual for hiv unfortunately  your symptoms are nonspecific and i can not tell you what is causing them without comprehensive history and physical examination
12557,probably not hiv infection is generally asymptomatic  although an acute infection can present as an acute flu condition also  symptoms are not localized with hiv  the affect the body as a whole if you are straight  have not have unprotected gay sex  or share needles for illicit drug use  your chances of having hiv are remote
12558,so you had viral or bacterial infection  your lymph nodes reacted to fight infection smoking not good
12559,pain your pain may possibly be due to acid reflux or a post nasal drip
12560,enlarged lymph nodes are almost always caused by an infection it is probably not related to shoulder pain ear pain might be occult infection however  if your doctor says it is nothing  most likely it is just that if it persists or worsens  consult your doctor again
12561,infection it is probably due to a dental or gum infection in your mouth sometimes you may not have oral symptoms a dentist is a good place to start a skin infection on the face is also possible
12562,adenopathy sounds like a generalized viral process with your neck and feet symptoms hand foot and mouth a possibility however you are older other infections like strep  mono  coxsackie possible if you have a high fever  headache or neck stiffness likely best to get checked
12563,get evaluated there are too many possible answers to your problems they may be unrelated to each other you should be evaluated by a doctor
12564,evaluation needed any time there are swollen lymph nodes one should have concern could be mastitis  and needs treatment you need further evaluation by a doctor
12565,lymph node swollen  mobile  painful nodes at your age are more than likely inflammatory
12566,dental pains in 95% of the pains in the mouth and face to be of dental origin until proved otherwise earache can be caused by a wisdom tooth or molar back tooth that has not fully erupted through the gum tissue rec: see your dentist for examination  xrays and treatment
12567,b sure u saw an  orthopedic surgeon or a upper extremity specialist or hand sports med orthopedist may wrist fractures do not show up on early x rays get in 2 b reevaluated
12568,recurrence you need to call your oncologist if it is a recurrence  rituximab can work again could be unrelated to your lymphoma but you should still call your oncologist
12569,need an evaluation thus could be rrlated to an infection but follicular lymphoma can return you should follow up with your oncologist
12570,no both values are within normal limits the ratio only matter if the levels are elevated
12571,many possibilities you may already know the answer by now  if you have seen the gi specialist elevated bilirubin may be side effect of drugs  excessive destruction of red cells  blockage to the flow of bile and more
12572,depends do you drink alcohol or take any medication  if yes  that may explain the elevated enzyme levels
12573,this requires further work up  stop alcohol if drinking
12574,white stools white stools warrant a follow up evaluation with your physician for additional lab work and likely a referral to a gi specialist take care of yourself and seek care in person with your doctor
12575,probably often a fasting lab will have a mild elevation of the bilirubin your other liver tests are not grossly abnormal if you have a greater risk for liver problems  it might be good to monitor the liver test periodically
12576,probably seem ok but lab values vary
12577,hepatitis there are numerous potential causes for elevation of these enzymes which often arise from the liver the most common cause may be nonalcoholic fatty liver  but there are many forms of viral hepatitis  alcohol  toxins  and so on that can also do this must be taken in the context of the clinical presentation lab data by itself is seldom diagnostic
12578,liver cell injury these enzymes are normally present in liver cells and are released into blood on injury to liver cells causing elevation of blood levels of alt ast
12579,a period its very common for people to lose their periods while on the mirena the lining of uterus shrinks and there isnt much to come out but once in a while people do get a period it could be because the iud hormone level is drifting down over time  or it could just be random its less blood than normal  and the blood can be dark i wouldnt worry wait and see what happens next month
12580,how high was your platelet count if it is less than 1 million  it should not become an excessive clotting problem platelet counts that are slightly elevated are common in inflammatory conditions  such as uc flare up ast and alt levels are also affected by many things  but in this range it is usually self limited have these studies checked again in a few weeks at your gi doctors office
12581,probably the slight increase in ast alt may be medication related  but the thrombocytosis can definitely be related to stress response of acute illness
12582,your orthopedic sur please go back to your orthopedic surgeon there may be a nerve entrapped  or exuberant bone regrowth in other words he may have more work to do if you dont get anywhere  then i might suggest a second opinion with a sports medicine specialist orthopedic surgeon
12583,fracture you can walk on it if the bone is non weight bearing like the fibula my question is why would you want to it may not heal in correct position or at all and why endure the pain get it checked to make sure its non displaced and stay off it unless the doctor has cleared you to do so
12584,broken ankle yes you could have a fracture in your ankle and still walk on it if there is continued pain and swelling  see your doctor
12585,sprained ankle see a podiatrist for a second opinion
12586,podiatry evaluation and xrays for starters mild antiinflammaory mediciation and good footwear definitely get a bloof sugar check aqnd hgba1c to evaluate diabetes status may be related to diabetic neuropathy see your physicianasap
12587,get an evaluation from a good podiatrist  you dont mention if there was any injury or not there could even be a fracture thats trapped other structures causing the spread of the pain from the ankle area to the ball of the foot
12588,ankle injury with ankle injuries  bones are only one level of concern we also have to worry about the ligaments which are most commonly injured during an ankle sprain and will not show up on plain film xrays i would recommend that you immobilize the limb as much as possible and consult with your closest podiatrist an mri of the best in order to rule out soft tissue injuries good luck
12589,knee pain you may just a severe contusion try ice and ibuprofen if it does not improve in a few days check with your doctor
12590,outer knee pain any injury may be meniscus degeneration  tendinitis   stress fracture  if active  or tibial plateau fracture try nsaids ice 15 minutes on 45 minutes off 34 x day  elevate  kinesiotape over sore spot  crutches for a few days and of course follow up with ortho as need xray to check for subtle fracture and may need 3 phase bone scan if still concerned about stress fracture with negative xray
12591,seek reevaluation without knowing any more specifics about the actual location size and status of the avulsion fracture  it is reasonable to recommend that you seek reevaluation by your treating surgeon at this time
12592,i would recommend you see a foot and ankle doctor the doctor ail likely take xrays to make sure there is no injury to the bone and be able to offer you a diagnosis and treatment plan the lip may be a number of things and this is why an evaluation is important ganglion  swelling from injury ie ankle sprain etc etc
12593,injury to tendons many times we strain ligaments and tendons  without realizing or remembering when you injure an extensor tendonfunction in raising the toes and foot it will hurt to flex and point your toes the injury only hurts at the end range of motion we tend to keep walking on such injures and they become slow to heal resting such injuries  result in a faster recovery
12594,many possibilities your pain could be as a result of many different things a thorough history and physical exam and possibly some laboratory and radiology exams are needed to determine the exact cause causes of pain may include: trauma fracture  sprain  arthritis  infection  metabolic conditions gout  musculoskeletal or biomechanical abnormality and neurologic conditions neuropathy
12595,hashimotos hi you have hashimotos by autoantibodies  with normal thyroid function not uncommon  when you look for it the degree of autoantibody elevation does not predict when the thyroid function will fail and theres no treatment for the high tpo autoantibodies your thyroid function should be followed periodical and anytime new symptoms arise good luck
12596,no intervention your thyroid antibody level is very high and it is quite likely that at some time in future  you will become hypothyroid the labs at this time do not indicate hypothyroidism  despite your symptoms there is not a practical mechanism to lower your thyroid antibody level
12597,it varies the high tsh  but normal t4 and t3 show that you have mild hypothyroidism it is possible that you are recovering from an episode of thyroid inflammation subacute thyroiditis if you have symptoms of a low thyroid  it makes sense to start thyroid hormone the dose varies depending on your size  age  how well you absorb the medication usually one starts with a low dose and gradually increase
12598,still can be hypothyroid repeat and see endocrinologist
12599,thyroid no
12600,well fortunately your thyroid function test are normal they should be checked about every year realize  that symptoms of hypothyroidism are similar to depression  or other diseases you may want to have a serious conversation with your dr or get another one
12601,not hypothyroid from the data you provided the thyroid antibodies as well as the family history indicate that you also have hashimotos thyroiditis i suggest you contact your pcp
12602,normal values the lab results you provided are within normal range and it is unlikely that you are hypothyroid it would be prudent to consult an endocrinologist for care as this is not an issue for self testing and or self care http:  wwwnlmnihgov medlineplus ency article 003444htm
12603,normal values the lab results you provided are within normal range and it is unlikely that you are hypothyroid it would be prudent to consult an endocrinologist for care as this is not an issue for self testing and or self care http:  wwwnlmnihgov medlineplus ency article 003444htm
12604,antithyroid abs antithyroid anti bodies  the two main are: antithyroglobulin antibodies and anti tpo antibodies  but i would rather run those tests by the endocrinologist looking after you  and you would better have one if you havent seen one already  take care
12605,thyroid abs and many people who are clinically hypothyroid have normal tests as what is normal is debatable many believe any tsh above 3 is too high  some even above 2 check antithyroglobulin and tpo antibodies but also test free t3 and reverse t3 see http:  tinyurlcom koyamo5 and http:  tinyurlcom nrww2qg and http:  wwwstopthethyroidmadnesscom tshwhyitsuseless 
12606,hypothyroid your thyroid level is way too low please follow the instructions given you by your physician no physician would be prescribing you this dose given your lab results
12607,it depends upon how low your body temperature is its probably normal  but check w your doctor if thyroid levels are normal  its not your thyroid make sure you are receiving brand name t4 replacement  as the generics are unreliable
12608,needs to be followed a slightly elevated tsh could well be a minor lab error i would not start treatment based on that if you repeat the tests  the tsh could be normal next time however  this could be the beginning of thyroid failure your doctor should repeat the tsh and ft4 in 36 months  and begin treatment if the tsh is clearly on the rise
12609,hard to say submissions to the site should include a description of the problem such as symptoms  duration  events and supportive data this lab is not particularly notable for anythingyet without information on why it was obtained  that is all i can say
12610,liver damage yes these liver tests are remarkably abnormal and represent significant danger for your liver and your life the cause of these abnormalities must be found and treated appropriately and  this is an urgent problem
12611,yes indeed your physician may take you off all meds and alcohol and repeat  or simply go on to test you for hepatitis b and c  hemochromatosis  wilsons  autoimmune hepatitis and perhaps a few others if no cause is found  aerobic exercise may be the way to better allaround health and lower liver enzymes
12612,probably reactive you are anemic and the numbers are suspicious for iron deficiency if you are a healthy 34 yearold who menstruates regularly  you could easily be low in iron the plaelet count is very high  but is likely reacting to the low iron and should come down if it is replaced the elevated white cells wbc is not as easy to understand inflamation  infection  other could use more info good luck
12613,yes here#x27s why reference ranges are set so that a few percent of healthies fall outside on either side counts  especially whites  fluctuate wildly even from hour to hour while low serum ferritin requires an explanation are you sure you do not have colon   stomach cancer  whats most concerning is that your and your personal physician have not chatted about labs despite your interest please do it soon
12614,abstain from alcohol and also get an abdominal ultrasound  i f you use alcohol regularly  repeat tests in 4 weeks after abstaining yes your tests are indicative of alcoholic hepatitis
12615,yes stop drinking and get checked in two weeks if its still up  your physician will proceed with a workup for other causes of elevated liver enzymes
12616,no only the absolute numbers matter  and even these fluctuate wildly with the vicissitudes of daily living  something as simple as a cold shower completely changes them nobody needs machinecountable basophils
12617,no worry the percentages are not as important as the absolute numbers the numbers you report are unexciting
12618,could have been viral infection follow up with pcp
12619,relax based on your note above  there is no indication to be concerned about a blood cancer monocytes are doing their job likely trying to fight off your infection just follow up with your doctor as you recover in a couple weeks and ensure any abnormalities resolve
12620,no even if this is not a contaminated sample  if you have no symptoms you are close enough to the reference range to consider yourself healthy
12621,how do you feel the urine test contains some abnormal findings but does not show a typical picture of urinary tract infection how you feel is more important try to increase fluid intake if you experience fever  burning sensation  low back pain  low abdominal pain  urinary frequency and urgency  you may need antibiotic treatment a urine culture would be helpful
12622,yes iron deficiency for some reason often shoots platelets up this is high but ive seen it before as a result of iron deficiency its most important that you find out why you are iron deficient and address the underlying cause
12623,abnormal these test results are abnormal the wbc and neutrophil counts are high  and the hemoglobin and hematocrit are highnormal what is the context of the test results is there an infection present
12624,yes  but it depends every womans breast cancer is unique to her because of that  treatment for each cancer is individualized  some cancers require surgery  others need more help in terms of removing lymph nodes  receiving medicine to kill cancer cells chemotherapy  or xrays to kill cancer cells radiation therapy there are other new techniques that are not standard your doctor recommends the best for you
12625,starndard treatments standard treatments for breast cancer are based upon the stage extent of confinement versus spread of the disease treatments can include surgery  radiation therapy  chemotherapy  hormonal therapy  and targeted drug therapy to interact with specific proteins on cells i do not know about vitamin therapy for breast cancer
12626,as for other cancers surgery  radiation and or chemotherapy if you use vitamin d as an alternative to all three of these  yore a dead fool vitamin d deficiency might put a woman at greater risk for breast cancer it does have some potent effects on cell growth but as a treatment  i dont think so new biologicals such as herceptin  and taxols  might be placed apart from chemo tumor lymphocytes are a novel rx
12627,3 months i tell patients they will have a buzz cut at 3 months hope this helps
12628,about 34 weeks hair is a dividing cell chemotherapy affects dividing cells for up to 34 weeks after treatment this would be when hair starts to grow it will take months for females to return to normal hair length
12629,tolerable it can be rough on some people but generally tolerable depending on the drug regimen used  some can make the hair fallout temporarily  give some figure tip  and toe numbness  and make a person weak and immune compromised for a short while but if your medical oncologist recommends it  it is because the benefits outweighs the risks of potential side effects
12630,breast ca treatment chemotherapy nowadays is way more tolerable than many years ago we do have good product to prevent side effects there are many kinds of chemo  the possible side effects will depend on the type of chemo we use chemo both as a single agent and combination of more than one kind depending on the treatment goal we also have targetted therapy as well as hormonal therapy in addition to chemo
12631,not all depends on stage patients with very early stage have extremely low risk of having detectable metastases on a scan so we usually dont do scans unless there is a symptom or a sign of potential spread patients with higher stage or inflammatory cancers usually get initial staging scans because they have higher odds of having mets in the end it should be a judgment call of the treating doc
12632,the use of mammography as a screening test has been validated by many years of outcomes data thermography  not so much
12633,mamms much better thermography identifies temperature changes on the skin since cancers often have higher blood flow  it may detect a cancerous hot spot though tested since the 1950s  it is much less sensitive than mammography for identifying breast cancerespecially small ones proponents of thermx favor the absence of radiation exposure however  the radiation associated w modern mammography is minimal
12634,you must pay attention to your oncologist   follow the advise   as so many good options are available in the treatment at your stage  if needed take a second opinion   good luck
12635,it varies most patients receiving chemotherapy can expect hair loss and some nausea but they can be easily managed and stop soon after chemotherapy has been completed
12636,several hair loss  nausea  fatigue  risk for infection however  the incidence of nausea is a lot less now with newer medications hope this helps
12637,depends on how advanced her cancer is and what shes been thru thus far for example  if she has only involvement in bones and shes taking an antiestrogen pill  she could be with you for quite a while if shes been thru mult chemo regimens and cancer is in her lungs  liver  brain and bone  time would be quite short if its the latter  i would strongly advise enrollment with a good hospice program
12638,need more info it would be wise to call your ophthalmologist and let him her know about this cyst
12639,get it checked you dont want wheezing to continue untreated  as it may worsen and make it harder for you to breathe
12640,see a doctor it is important that you see a doctor and find out what is going on wheezing can be a sign of a serious problem get treated
12641,depends ask your eye surgeon it depends on how deviated the eyes were before if he or she used adjustable sutures  it may be necessary to touch up your surgical correction
12642,confusing question proper vision requires brain input of 2 similar sharp images by well aligned eyeballs if one eye is sharper than the other  or alignment is bad the brain may turn off one eye to stop a blurred imageif the vision is off in one eye for an extended periodyrs  amblyopia lazy eye can be permanent alignment surgery may not hold without vision to keep it on tractrevision may be necessary cosmetic
12643,it may recur the probability is about 2040%
12644,either may help you have not mentioned your age this will have bearing on it if you are too young if you are over 15  18 you should ask your opthalmologist if you are able to keep it in most of the time i would try therapy first to avoid surgery  best wishes
12645,glasses this sounds like accommodative esotropia glasses or contact lenses are usually used to control this
12646,more info needed if you mean blood and tissue coming from the vagina  no that is not normal  and needs prompt evaluation if you mean blood and tissue coming out of your incisions  that is also not normal  and needs emergent evaluation recurrent ovarian cysts can be prevented with medicinedepending on your pregnancy goals
12647,i would make sure you do not have a clot in your calf  if there is swelling in the leg this should be reported to your md immediately
12648,check with eye dr you should be able to call your local ophthalmologist and get a price for 1 evaluation and 2 treatment
12649,smoking related you may have asthma  and or be affected by your smoking first  try quitting smoking and see if that makes a difference you can also see your primary care provider or a lung specialist and have a test called spirometry  which can measure your lung capacity and make a diagnosis of asthma  if that is what you have
