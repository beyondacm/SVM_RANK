58,depends of swelling tedhose can help control leg swelling after total knee replacement if your postoperative swelling is under control  it would be fine to stop the tedhose
59,not necessarily it depends how long after the surgery  swelling is usually related to an inflammatory response that could be caused by an infection or a traumatic event  but not always i need more details to try and determine the cause
60,talk to your doc talk to your knee surgeon about suggested outcome and restrictions following treatment of your specific knee condition many factors enter into the advice you receive
61,yes much better total knee replacement is made to reduce pain and improve function patients walk much better after recovering from a total knee than they did before total knee surgery most walk close to normal or normal once they have fully recovered
62,yes cetainly in my hands
63,physical therapy the post surgery rehabilitation is as important as the surgery itself it is important to regain range of motion early to avoid the development of scar tissue which will impede further progress once this has been done  the knee can be strengthened post knee replacement rehab can be done in the inpatient and outpatient setting expect about a 3 month recovery period
64,slow recovery your pain will improve slowly over months the first two weeks are the toughest for everyone walker for 24 weeks then a cane and that is usually done by 6 weeks some go back to work at 48 weeks formal therapy for 612 weeks pain varies narcotics usually for 312 weeks most activity by 12 weeks but stiff with little aches for months 1218 months for complete recovery great relief at end

69,possible  but is it possible that one is an investment banker and drive from li to nyc directly from the surgical suite after taking oxycodone  weave in and out of cars no traffic at 2pm  avoid getting pulled over by cops  almost causing an accident   multiple injuries fatalities on the way  in order to get to that meeting because one feels that its crucial to be at the meeting to close a $1b deal sure

71,common with oa one of the common symptoms of joint osteoarthritis is that the joints become stiff and painful after brief or extended inactive periods usually when you get up  you will need to wait a few moments  then the first few steps are more difficult  but once you get going it becomes less achy this again happens after sitting down for a while evaluation for osteoarthritis would be a start
72,see an orthopaedist pain within the knee and or hip can be a sign of arthritis or other joint pathology a consult with an orthopaedic surgeon  with xrays of both the knee and hip  would be a good place to start to help identify the source of the problem
73,extremely important physical therapy is crucial for full functional recovery after a total knee replacement i believe that therapy should start as soon as possible  ideally the day after your surgery physical therapy should include soft tissue mobilization  joint mobilization  and strengthening exercises finding a skilled physical therapist is key to a complete recovery after receiving your new knee joint
74,very important physiotherapy is extremely important to regain mobility and strength of the knee  as well as to look at the entire kinetic chain from the ankle to the pelvis low back for compensations that have occurred presurgery we believe therapy should start the day following surgery to reduce swelling and scar tissue formation and to strengthen the core and muscles of the leg
75,do all of the above but definitely see your surgeon  to be examined and investigated good luck
76,knee locking you should have this discussion with your surgeon if he does not give you a satisfactory answer and solution  it is okay to get a second opinion
77,physical therapy ++ yoll certainly need to build up the muscles that attach to the knee quads  hamstrings  calf muscles etc  and do a lot of specified therapy by a well trained sports physical therapist but when  or if  you should go back to playing football will be related to what type of football  what level of play  what procedure u had  how well u recovered: in other words  what the orthopod says
78,common common  not normal see your surgeon
79,ask ur surgeon most surgeons have their own protocol 4 post op pain   u should b asking him her general things as elevate  ice  rest may help it depends how far out u r from ur surgery but dont b bashfull ask your surgeon for help

85,meniscus best to consult your orthopedic surgeon
86,call and ask whether you need a knee brace after your surgery depends on what type of knee surgery you are having  and what the surgeons protocols are best to call the office and ask
87,depends this surgeon variable for ligament reconstruction depends on type of surgery and the surgeon
88,cold foot after surg it is not good go back to the orthopedic surgeon that did the knee he she was in there that person knows what was seen and done they will have the best knowledge about this

91,need antipsychotic for your sleep it would be nice to use an antipsychotic other than seroquel  however  if the seroquel is working  you have to weigh the risk  benefit ratio of possible relapse it is hard to recommend something without knowing your formal diagnosis in general  the more sedating an antipsychotic is  the more prone to weight gain it can be discuss saphris with your doc it is sedating  but less wt
92,nonot safe seroquel is a class c drug and has been known to cause harm to the fetus trazedone also is not safe  is a class c drug  and may cause harm they should be used only if the benefits outweigh the possible harm they are not safe  and risks are clearly present for birth defects  miscarriages  and for trazedone  the drug can pass to the newborn through breast milk

94,garcinia is not fda approved hence side effects and interactions are not wellknown my patients do report that it is ineffective for weightloss
95,encourage you to see a psychiatrist if an atypical antipsychotic is needed there are a number of other choices in addition to zyprexa zyprexa is well known for the side effect of weight gain if sleep is the only condition the zyprexa is being used for  there are also sleep medications that can be used if your nurse practioner is not familiar with other treatment options  then seeing a psychiatrist
96,clearance of all of these drugs will take a few days at most i hope you are coming off these meds under the guidance of a physician
97,only if it has been prescribed if you are not used to taking two mg  i usually would tell my patients to take 1mg if it is someone elses  do not take it at all if you were my patient i would have you take an extra05 mg of xanax instead you should really call your psychiatrist who i would hope is on call for you or has someone covering for directions also  discuss with him or her in advance what you shoulddo should the situation arise again i like to have my patients have a contingency plan in advance also remember to practice good sleep hygiene best wishes

99,see your doctor if celexa is causing insomnia almost a month into treatment  discuss with your doctor the idea of a different medication for the same goal there are many other ssri or snri medications that might be helpful without causing insomnia and then you wouldnt need to add trazadone or another medication for sleep the chance is very good that you would do well with a different medication good luck
100,celexa since u r on 2 antidepressants and assuming they are helping your depression  it is best to work with what u r taking   under advisement from your doctor  and maximize the dose instead of adding another medicine or switching one idea is taking celexa in morning  trazodone up to 300mg at bedtime discuss with your doctor

106,yes the antihistamine in nyquil doxylamine succinate will provide the side effect of drowsiness like all antihistamines if it works tonight for sleep you develop quick tolerance to it as a sleep aide also  if you dont need the other ingredients  i would avoid taking nyquil just as a sleep aide for insomnia issues  cognitive behavioral therapy is the best treatment: see wwwshutime
107,depression continue to see your doctor but you should also consider a consult with a psychologist they can be very helpful and will look after you but might also find some issues that dictate you need to go back to your doctor for more care

111,semen no protection you will know if you are pregnant within 2 weeks: if no one explained this to you semen plus unprotected sex usually equals pregnancy if you dont want someone calling you mommy  get on birth control and always use condoms k

117,need more info i would need more information to form an opinion: what imaging study was done where is the stone what size if it is 5 mm or less  it will pass but there will be pain larger size frequently needs interventionyour doctor should be following you or referring you to a urologist best wishes
118,kidney stone it really depends on the size and location of the kidney stone smaller stones < 4 mm have a greater than 50% chance of passing however if the stone is in the kidney it makes it more difficult to predict when it will pass
119,yes this mandates medical evaluation immediately
120,call your surgeon could be a sign of blood clots in the legs  but both sides would be unusual your surgeon or their coverage will take your call  and they will know the case best
121,you need to check out your diet instead of popping pills the villain usually is sugar in all its forms

123,pregnancy hi  usually if you had sex during fertile time which is usually 1116 days prior to the next period you could get pregnant some home pregnancy tests are more sensitive and could detect pregnancy up to a wk prior to the next period  so you can purchase one of those or go to ur doctors office and ask for blood bhcg possibly better result for you if period is irregular good luck

126,yes yes  in fact thats the most common way it starts shingles is almost always on only one side of the body  often in a stripe like pattern the lesion go from flat reddish  to clear blisters  to cloudy blisters  to open blisters  to crusted lesions early treatment with a type of antiviral drug can reduce the risk of chronic pain afterward postherpetic neuralgia see doctor soon
127,shingles it is possible to have the rash change over time  but a more common presentation is for there to be pain in the area where the future rash will develop this pain  rather than itching  leads into the full blown condition

132,good test mri does see the back of the knee and some problems  such as popliteal cysts  can cause pain there the posterior horns of the menisci are also at the back of the knee and mri can assess meniscal problems very well for best results  make sure a radiologist with fellowship training in musculoskeletal imaging is interpreting the study
133,see details it is impossible to be specific without being able to perform a neurologic evaluation in person have you seen a neurologist yet if not  see one if you have  ask that doctor 
134,cervical spine surge surgery should be your last option more than 90% of damaged discs heal by themselves over time for ongoing nerve pain and neck pain   you should get a cervical epidural steroid injection done by a qualified and experienced pain physician under xray guidance also start physical therapy as soon as you can to relieve muscular spasm
135,probably not an mri of the lumbar spine is usually narrowly focused on the spine your doctor may suspect there is a pinched nerve in your spine that is causing your pain a dedicated mri of the pelvis and or hip would be necessary to directly evaluate those structures docs may order combined mri lumbar spine and pelvis  but this is significant additional cost may be good to start with just one
136,say what and your question is
137,block if you had complete atrioventricular block it would be quite evident on the routine ecg if the ecg is normal  you dont have complete av block
138,it should mri is the test of choice to evaluate for nerve impingement
139,c nerve compression your symptoms are created by nerve root pressure decompression is essential spinal cord compression itself can worsen without decompression intervention once decompressed  arm symptoms should improve and resolve sooner is better long term compression can lead to irreversibility
140,many possibilities could be venous insufficienct which is a back up in the veins that causes pooling of blood in leg
141,pt tendonitis it certainly can be a sonogram or mri can detect tendonitis or other tendon pathology
142,it could be if you suspect that may be the problem  and it very well may be use supportive insoles like spenco total support http:  www spencocom products footcare totalsupportinsoles and try on otc antiinflammatory like aleve if this helps  see a podiatrist for rx orthotics and you should be good to go if not  see a podiatrist for an exam and proper diagnosis
143,lots of questions there are alot of questions to be answered before we can discuss surgical options especially if a mri is not showing anything first and foremost is your age and other symptoms therefore you should see a pmr or neurologist to thoroughly evaluate your symptoms i would be delighted to help you but need more information that the space has allowed you to provide
144,if no spot on the mri  then surgery is not indicated indeed  would be impossible to say where to do surgery and what to cut might mention that 50% of those with pain that seems like a disk do not have one on mri
145,pinched nerve  neck sounds like you have a pinched nerve in your neck and you need to get an mri of the cspine depending on the results it might be just short term that gets better spontaneously  or somthing that might need an epidural steroid injection or something that might require surgery good news is that most resolve on its own
146,analysis the muscle twitches over eye may be orbital myokymia  and the numb focal patches could be problem with small nerves  such as digital or sural you do not describe ms  and the cord compression may well be responsible for some of your symptoms
147,well now this being healthtap and not a doctors office  you wont get an answer to what it is  but normal mris pretty much rule out ms and a normal emg ncs rules out a largefiber neuropathy not everything our bodies do has a precise name or explanation sometimes you have to take the practical approach: if it goes on for 13 yr without change or anything else developing  its probably benign
148,mri only tells  part of the story if you have myoclonus and hyperreflexia  you must establish a strong relationship with a good neurologist in order to get diagnosed and treated as soon as possible north of the equator  there are several devastating neurological disorders that cause these symptoms  multiple sclerosis being only one of them please get yourself diagnosed quickly
149,yes if you have 4 bulging discs in your neck they could cause all the symptoms you just described on both sides if it was a c4 disc bulge that can also cause all the symptoms you just described lastly looking at your age  i would surprised to see a lot of pathology but it is possible if this was related to a car accident  it could also be whiplash injury as well
150,not sure pain in the areas listed are common and difficuilt to pinpoint as to cause muscles  tendons  joints  disks have all been blamed for such symptoms overuse  inflammation  trauma  stress can all be potential sources if you are not improving with time  exercise  over the counter medication  see your primary doctor or a spinal doctor
151,peroneal nerve the common peroneal nerve is susceptible to injury at the level of the knee as it circles the fibula findings can be subtle or absent on mri especially early and xray wont see it ask your doctor if your symptoms and signs suggest peroneal nerve injury ultrasound can be used to see if the nerve is swollen by comparing the symptomatic side with the opposite side
152,yes  but having another surgery is an option  but you should try conservative treatment like physical therapy first if you are having pain every time that you have surgery  you create more scar tissue before proceeding with surgery again  you should get a second opinion from another neurosurgeon or orthopedist
153,mri is reliable brain tumor can be easily seen on a mri of the brain like many cancers  these tumors evolve slowly  possibly over a period of many years  yet it is hard to pin down exact time frames
154,where does it hurt a torn meniscus usually causes catching  locking or buckling sensation to the knee it usually occurs after a twisting injury many people have some significant swelling an mri is the best test to diagnose this
155,not necessarily  older patients  or patients with djd of their knee can strectch their meniscus giving the same appearance on mri
156,pinched nerve because patients having cardiac problems can have these symptoms  you should have this ruled out but the most common cause is an irritation of a nerve in the neck by a bone spur or herniation that can cause pain or numbness that runs down the arm into the hand an mri can usually show the cause of the problem if it does not resolve thank you for the question
157,drop foot ms is not the only cause of a drop foot deformity muscle weakness is possibly from nerve damage which has many causes you should research other symptoms of ms and the testing treatments and talk to neurologist about any symptoms you have to help diagnose  resolve problems consider other more urgent causes such as stroke or cva
158,foot drop i agree  speak to your neurologist frankly and discuss your concerns good luck
159,different causes pain radiating down the neck to the shoulders levels  is very often generated by the cervical facets  usually the last 3 c45  c56 c67 a compressed nerve root gives you a radiculopathy down the arm but thecause of compression may be a herniated disc a neuroforaminal stenosis or a hypertrophied cervical facet that narrows the neuroforamina  or it can be compressed anywhere else down the path
160,yes chondromalasia takes time to develop not an acute problem
161,disc disease typically a disc herniation will heal over time 7080% of the time pt if debilitated you can also try inversion table and or epidural steroids
162,see below some lung cancers will show up on a chest xray or may be better seen on ct scan male breast cancer would show up on a mammogram xray  not a plain chest xray
163,breast no lung yes breast cancer does not show up on routine x rays only mammogram  ultrasound  and targettted mri most but not all lung cancers show up on chest x ray
164,arthritis they are arthritic overgrowth of bone in the fine structures of the cervical spine
165,bone spurs the report is describing parts of the cervical spine where the nerves exit between the vertebra and can pinch a nerve
166,no sometimes multiple sclerosis does not show up on mris speak to your neurologist for more details
167,not ms address spinal cord compression issues
168,physical therapy you can always try things like physical therapy  massage or chiropractics but sometimes depending on the severity of the disk herniation  surgery is the best option would also suggest a 2nd opinion from another surgeon to see if they agree
169,exercise options to surghery are exercise  rest  anti spasm medication surgery last resort especailly for builging discs better get another opinion and make sure you had a discogram test
170,yes this side effect is called peripheral neuropathy  and its common many types of chemotherapy are toxic to nerves  and the more doses you receive the more the nerves are affected taxol and taxotere are particular culprits symptoms of neuropathy usually lessen with time once yore off the chemo but it can take a year or two
171,mild neuropathy sometimes irritated nerves cause tingling  normally in the toes and feet  sometimes in the hands tingling or burning is a symptom of neuropathy  but it does not clinch the diagnosis high blood sugar and deficient vitamin b12 are common causes of a symptom like this be sure you are checked out for causes of neuropathy
172,not commonly zoloft main side effects are diarrhea and sexual dysfunction or decreased libido you may be having an interaction with zoloft and another drug or something else is going on you should follow with your doctor for further work up
173,see your doctor it is prudent to pay attention to any visual symptoms fuzzy sight can be a number of things  but in conjunction to the other symptoms it is best to see your ophthalmologist  and a neurologist to be able to fully evaluate these comprehensively
174,it can some patients of migraine do have neurological symptoms like yours often on one side associated with it these are transient and resolve as migraine improves
175,it depends migraines can cause numbness or tingling sensations to certain individuals  however  if this is something new to your attack   pls consult your doctor right away to rule out other nneurological diseases such as stroke
176,feet maybe  hands no the sciatic nerve runs from the gluteal region your rear end down the back of your leg  then branches to innervate the back of the thigh and leg as well as the outer part of the lower leg and then parts of the feet an injury may cause those symptoms there  as well as problems with motion the major nerves that serve the hands are the radial  ulnar and median
177,no a pinched sciatic nerve will not cause wrist symptoms or numbness in the hands a pinched sciatic nerve may cause symptoms of the leg
178,no  but vit b6 b12  most likely see your pcp
179,neuropathy please explore causes of neuropathy through web md or other educational web sides in young age if these symptoms are occurring with muscle twitching then i would make sure no toxins  drugs or chemical exposure  causing these if none of above then report to neurologist
180,pains extremities hi jerryk752  this is an odd symptom it could be due to nerve entrapment if you are overweight other than that  it could be due to mild strain during normal use i would see a doc to do a blood count and esr and if normal i would be reassured unless it gets much worse thanks
181,neuropathy  neuropathy is a comon cause of tingling and numbness to the hands and feet  specially if diabetes is present  duration of symptoms is also very important   as well as family history neurodegenerative disorders must be excluded  if history or physical exam is suggestive vitamin and nutritional deficencies is a rare cause  but possible if an enteropathy is present  or bariatric surgery was done
182,numbness most concerning is the pain in the right arm if this is something new it needs evaluation by a physician the diffuse numbness and tingling could be from any number of causes an infectious or inflammatory workup may also be indicated again  the pain and lack of movement in the right arm needs more immediate attention
183,likely beneficial no medication is without any side effect but if your doctor prescribes it try it benefits are likely to outweigh risks
184,neuropathy you should contact your doctor asap  and get evaluated you may have a peripheral neuropathy or even lumbosacral spinal stenosis
185,plethora of symptoms deserves thorough medical history and physical exam see a doctor
186,see derm a dermatologist can do a work up to find the cause they may have other specialists help
187,pesticides a shortterm veggie juice fast is a great way to fast you get loads of phytonutrients and enough calories so you are not miserable when you fast you should know  however  that juicing can also concentrate pesticides used on the veggies some people react to the pesticides if this is the case  you need to switch to organic veggies veggie allergies are also possible best wishes
188,possible vitamin deficiency caused by limited diet you should go back to a natural and complete diet and see if symptoms improve
189,not usually more likely nerve compression  but needs to check pulses  thoracic outlet  or central nervous system stroke
190,usually not the arm discomfort associated with cardiac issues is mostly present on the inner part of the upper left arm it is also not usually present as an isolated symptom that said  if you are concerned  its best to talk with your doctor and review your risk factors for heart disease
191,possibly anxiety sometimes this constellation of symptoms can represent physical symptoms of anxiety  panic disorder  or severe stress however it is important to see your doctor to rule out things like vitamin deficiencies like b12  folic acid  or vit d  and other conditions like thyroid disorders
192,talk to your doctor you need a history and exam it could be nothing could be worsened by anxiety could be something serious such as myelopathy
193,no tingling and burning collectively called paresthesias medically are symtoms of peripheral nerve dysfunction sounds like yore compressing a trigger point its more common with certain diseases such as diabetes but can occur in normal people as well
194,numbness  tingling there are variety possible causes for this condition including musculusskeletal disorders of the cervical area  multiple sclerosis or carpal tunnel syndrome  just to name a few the treatment will depend on your diagnosis without the diagnosis is a guessing game rec: see interventional pain management specialist for further investigation and management
195,possibly there could be a cure for extremity numbness  but it will depend on the cause of the numbness possible causes include nerve impingement  diabetes  thyroid disorders  and many other possibilities best to see your doctor to find the actual cause first
196,severe dizziness and lightheaded feeling warrants a medical visit that is the priority now please see a doc asap
197,may be a migraine go see your dr
198,evaluation any time you have these generalized symptoms you should visit your doctor for an evaluation this could be from something easy to manage as dehydration to something more complicated as a pinched nerve in the spinal cord wwwotwithmdcom
199,not my first choice more likely carpal tunnel syndrome or other peripheral nerve compression
200,unlikely to be ms as more common diagnoses like carpal t syndrome  cubital t syndrome  are far more common others  like a c spine injury lesion would need to be excluded all these could be investigated treated by your orthopod consult him her
201,most likely anxiety most likely anxiety but a good idea to get checked out by the physician and try to rule out some of those other possibilities
202,see doctor this should certainly be examined it could be neuropathy
203,difficult to say there could be several possible explanations peripheral neuropathy  cervical myelopathy and ms are amongst the common conditions causing such symptoms consultation with a neurologist would be advisable to determine the correct diagnosis and start appropriate treatment
204,can be many reasons why this is happening you need to see a doctor for a good physical exam
205,pain this is not enough information
206,beware numbness beware unexplained numbness these symptoms may not make sense to most practitioners  but may be the earliest unexplained signs of worrisome conditions like transverse myelitis or multiple sclerosis these are rare but serious diagnoses that often began with numbness if these persist or seem to worsen  see your neurologist many a person with these diagnoses have initially been labeled: crazy
207,zoloft yes  depending on the dose  how long u have been on the medication  and how rapidly u were tapered off of it if symptoms not releaved within a week  talk to the prescribing doctor
208,it can be talk to your doctor if these are withdrawal related symptoms perhaps you can be taken off the medication more gradually
209,nerve symptoms there is no single nerve or even area of the brain that may cause sensory symptoms all over on both sides the causes of these symptoms are more likely not primarily neurological but more metabolic such as hypocalcemia or hyperventilation etc
210,see details there are several treatment options i have had good results with gabapentin in this situation talk to a rheumatologist
211,see details the is really no such thing as psoriasis with features of lupus however  with proper medical treatment the prognosis is very good as long as significant damage has not already occurred
212,leg pain sounds like sciatica referred pain may be hip arthritis or synovitis check with your orthopedic surgeon get imaging
213,many things systemic inflammation acute infection  autoinflammatory diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis  stress emotional or physical  hypersensitivity to pain or abnormal pain suppression pathways fibromyalgia  joint abnormalities connective tissue diseases such an marfan syndrome or ehlerdanlos syndrome  blood disorders anemia  leukemia and many more would need more info to fine tune
214,see md need more information but might be something that needs immediate attention see md or go to er now
215,depends on the injur it depends on the severity of the injury i generally recommend you avoid exercises that increase loading to your spine or impact activities thus  biking or elliptical machines or swimming are better than running also  no heavy weight lifting that loads your back such as squats
216,a lot lifestyle changes are important like not smoking  weight control and regular exercise you can use medication if no contraindications like ibuprophen or naproxen  try a back support  guided exercise  activity modification if no better  then see your doctor for further evaluation and treatment exercise can include walking  elliptical and stairmaster machines to start and then increase it
217,see md if present for more than a week  see md for exam otherwise may be uri which is self limited to about a week otc meds
218,rash sounds like contact with an allergen or eczema see your doctor or send us a picture if you are not allergic to benadryl take it every 68 hours for symptoms
219,get tested for arthritis it could be rheumatoid arthritis take care
220,too vague when it started how log pain lasts when does it happen
221,i can believe that you dont have arthritis at age 20 and am happy that you dont have it however  i am certain that yore not an enigma therefore  somethings going on and needs to be nailed downand its not just growing painsyove grown lol i believe you may benefit from sharing results of tests thatve been done with xrays cts etc uploaded send message if yod like: wwwhealthtapcom drsaghafi
222,see a physiatrist i would recommend that you see a physiatrist who is a specialist in treatment of pain conditions a physiatrist is an md or a do medical doctor who has trained to treat problems like yours
223,be seen the numbness is more important that the pain  but you should be evaluated
224,herniated disk could be a ruptured disk in neck  especially since yove had the same symptoms before  which is typical did u get ant treatmenttx then place to start is w  fam doc for pain meds  referral for mri steroids  pt would be initial tx  unless weakness is present  in which case more urgent surgery may be necessary  but most resolve without if persists or recurs  surgery more likely 
225,see your doctor there are multiple reasons for the symptoms you describe it is important to get a medical evaluation you could see your family doctor who may then refer you to specialist like a neurologist  neurosurgeon or a pain physician depending on the cause  you may be prescribed medications  physical therapy  nerve blocks or surgery
226,yes amp no  45 yo asks if 3 yrs right r low back pain lbp  sciatica s caused her neck arthritis assumptions: is neck pain  xray w ddd cspine   r sacroiliac joint disorder sijd chronic s commonly due to sijd lbp common w sijd unilateral sijd causes upper body tilt  ipsilateral head tilt  contralateral superior trap chronic painful spasm ddd nonpainful red herring see osteopath
227,see your doctor cervicalgia  is basically a pain in the neck most of the time  cervicalgia may be due to a muscle strain or ligament sprain the headaches and general stiffness in the neck  are symptoms of classic cervicalgia if your discomfort does not go away with rest  nsaids otc  and moist heat packs  you need to see a doctor
228,see details if the problem is significant  have it evaluated there are several possible causes
229,headache back left sided headache tension headache would be most likely the insertion of your frontooccipital muscle is in that area and that can tighten and hurt could be neck problem referring to that area or a greater occipital neuralgia that is a nerve that runs behind your ear that can get irritated
230,paracervical strain it sound like you may be suffering from a paracervical muscle strain i recommend trying moist heat  gentle neck massage and ibuprofen or naproxen i would also purchase a cervical pillow these may also be a sign of tension headaches  often due to stress  so include relaxation techniques seek medical attention if your symptoms persist or worsen take care
231,radicular nick pain that radiates down to the arms is often from degenerative disc disease at prices or pictures on the nerve see if physician for evaluation and xrays
232,r o disc disease your description of the pain sounds neuropathic in nature  you need a full exam and focused neuro exam full lab tests including tfts  vit b12 vit d  lyme disease if symptoms persist an you have increased knee reflexes  mri of brain would be needed to evaluate for ms if reflexes are weak or foot drop is present mri of cervical spine is needed to rule out herniated disc or mass effect
233,many things could be anything from a burn to tonsilitis and many others you need a visual exam to determine and narrow down the possibilities
234,see details see a rheumatologist to learn your specific treatment options
235,scoliosis how long have you been dealing with the pain what you done for muscle pain before you need to consult a physician for physical exam to exclude neuropathy or other pathologies and likely get started on muscle relaxants  antiinflammatories and analgesics as well as referral to physical therapy
236,not sure about the cause of the gas get discharge checked symptoms of a yeast infection may include: burning  redness  itching of the vulva burning with urination  vaginal intercourse  a clumpy  white  vaginal discharge with no odor sometimes the discharge isn’t apparent
237,rash sounds like a viral infectious ifit came on suddenly  you need to have checked y adoctor asap
238,maybe sinus disease a history of congestion with drainage in your throat and with head pain suggests sinusitis if you are coughing frequently that may cause head pain see your doctor to confirm your diagnosis gentle saline in both nares may help to thin and clear the mucus
239,headache if its in the front maybe sinus or allergy related and you could try a decongestant and ibuprofen if its after 5 dont take the decongestant ifs its in the back or sides may be viral and try the ibuprofen if its bad or persistent check it out
240,bulging disc and or pinched nerve can be caused by being sandwiched between two spinal bones  pressed by a bulging it can cause muscle spasm and back pain prevention treatment is always recommended this condition must be professionally managed see interventional pain management specialist for definitive diagnosis and management
241,traction i recommend over door traction device at your drug store id also recommend you find a do a doctor of osteopathy who does manipulationnot many of us leftbut we can often be helpful for this problem
242,details matter itch eczema is common in this area  but not the only possible explanation if you see a dermatologist  she will examine your skin and ask many questions be sure to bring anything you have applied
243,many possibilities need details: bone vs joint symptoms fever rash bruising current pain meds pain all the time since when chronic pain = more than 12 months describe the pain age other medical problems last time you saw a doctor changes in meds ill try to help by grouping your questions together good for you  for asking the questions though
244,complicated case it looks like you are having a neuropathic pain from the distribution of your pain in any case your presentation is a bit concerning and advise you to see your family doc so that you can get the assessment and treatment best wishes
245,need eval it sounds like nerve irritation neuropathic pain but it would be difficult to clarify as a very young woman breast cancer is unlikely but not unheard of the distribution of pain is unusual but may be coming from neck also if there is a rash present you have to think about shingles go see your physician
246,see your doctor most likely a yeast infection  but could be herpes it needs to be examined and cultured swab for herpes and koh prep for yeast yeast can be easily treated  but can be a symptom of other problems  like diabetes
247,could be psoriasis this could be psoriasis or a superficial skin cancer get that thing checked out asap
248,possibly can be done fibroadenoma is a benign tumor it can be observed occasionally it can regress sometimes it can grow larger or change if it changes significantly  it is best to remove it your fibroadenomas size is bordeline for nonsurgical removal which can be done by vacuum assisted large biopsy needles or by ablation or freezing it look for a breast surgeon experienced in either of above procedures
249,not possible if you want to be rid of the lump  its a simple surgical procedure
250,when in doubt if you are concerned that you could have a breast mass = then get it checked out by your physician take care
251,breast size you can build up chest muscles w exercise  weight lifting but it will not ^ the amt of fatty tissue
252,unlikely pain in and around the breast is not a common symptom of breast cancer most breast cancers present as a painless lump pain is typically a late symptom of cancer in general including breast cancer if you are concernd check yourself for any lumps in the breast or go see your family doctor give your young age the odds of breast cancer right now would be low in your case
253,probably not would need to see a doctor for an examination  but pain is not a common symptom of breast cancer painless firm breast mass is more common breast and axillary pain can be from inflammation or muscle pains see a doctor for an examination
254,generally no  however fillings fall out for several reasons if it was just old and fell out no decay generally no problem if it fell out because of decay it really depends on the amount of decay present but it still should not be painful regular check ups and cleanings can mitigate all of these types of problems
255,yes you are covered you are on antibiotics the pericoronitis is being caused by the interrelationship of your gums and wisdom tooth by extracting the tooth you will get rid of the pericoronitis problem  food impact ion  and gum infection
256,it can happen any type of breast surgery can cause bloody discharge from the nipple for a short period of time
257,generally to know what the lump is  assuming it is not a simple cyst  a biopsy is needed to get tissue from it and look at the cells under a microscope however  the ultrasound appearance can sometimes predict what the biopsy shows  based on the presence or absence of specific findings on the ultrasound image please see a breast health professional to discuss options based on the particular situation
258,it depends sometimes benign features are so characteristic on ultrasound that there is little chance of malignancy  and the lesion can be safely followed with serial imaging otherwise  biopsy is probably indicated
259,no hair falling out is a symptom of malnutrition  not necessarily due to b12 deficiency you cannot inject self withoyut knowing the cause
260,probably not vit b12 is the new energy zapper that docs are screening for now on standard tests alopecia hair loss can result from many things including stress #1 cause  thyroid problems  and malnutrition also medications can cause it go see your doctor for a lab test for b12 level thyroid panel before starting injectable b12 you may not need it  and injectable b12 is getting rare
261,dermatologist you should see a dermatologist as soon as possible for a diagnosis of your condition and proper treatment in the short term while awaiting an appointment you can take antihistamine like diphenhydramine or cetirizine if it is worsening or unbearable  go to an urgent care or er for more aggressive treatment
262,meniscus tear you probably have locking in you knee joint caused by internal derangement of the structure of your knee usually  plain old arthritis does not cause this type of complaint  so you may need an mri to more specifically define your problem and then help to direct the therapy that will fix your knee pain and limited range of motion
263,see doctor it is common to  have a sore throat and ear pain when there is an infection you should see your doctor about this
264,go see a doctor you probably need antibiotics  steroids  or both cough drops are not going to help either a viral or bacterial cause of a severe sore throat referred ear pain is common with sore throats you also need a prescription for antibiotics and steroids i would start with a visit to a doctor
265,pain the pain as described is unlikely to be cardiac
266,see a breast surgeon selfexamination definitely helps finding cancers but can be very difficult  since most women have lumpy  bumpy breasts breast examination supplemented by ultrasound is the best way to distinguish the two other studies including mammography  or even mri may sometimes be helpful ultimately  the only way to be certain is by tissue biopsy  which can almostalways be done under local anesthesia
267,sorry to hear thus see your oncologist for a full review of the treatment options best wishes
268,possibly cellulitis you may have a bacterial infection of the skin if there is a rash spreading did you pick the pimple if the redness doesnt go away see a doctor  you may need antibiotics
269,get checked by a dermatologist who can let you know what it is or need for more tests take care
270,poss costochondritis it sounds like an inflammation of the area where ribs meet the sternum try nsaids  like ibuprofen or naproxen as directed on the label it should resolve on its own if you develop shortness of breath or have swelling in your calves  see your doctor
271,see your pcp if the bump on your breast is getting worse you need to be seen either by your primary care provider or a dermatologist there is no way to say what it is without seeing it but anything that is getting worse rather than better is concerning hope this is better soon
272,could be an incisional hernia at trocar site have your surgeon take a look
273,swelling pain and swelling is the bodies way of telling you something is wrong in this case consult an orthopedic surgeon
274,chronic or acute pain in two joints  on the same side  may be due to overuse or bio mechanical problems if this is acute and you can account for it  increase in exercise  falling  sprain  etc i would see a doctor only if it is not improving with time or if you see redness and swelling
275,yes your treatment should be sufficient  but make sure your partner was checked treated and is clean as well you dont want a pingpong reinfection cycle to start
276,see remark if you mean alcohol  i suggest you abstain from it before the blood test
277,upper arm pain there can be many reasons including new injury  re injury and adhesions recommend rest  ice  and anti inflammatory ibuprofen naproxen and a visit to an orthopedist
278,not that i know but tanning can increase your risk of melanoma  which can be even more virulent this may be especially true if there is a brca mutation in your family which increases your risk for breast and ovarian cancer and also for melanoma nice as a tanned body may look and i would not argue with that it does so as a response to injury my advise: dont do it
279,herpes herpes are not pimples they are a cluster of blisters and are very painful
280,maybe unlikely if they dont hurt or burn but probably worth getting checked out by a doctor there are often community health clinics or even planned parenthood which will let you go without your folks otherwise an issue for 16 year olds and get seen free
281,the question could only be answered based on your current vision in that eye and eye examination treatment is usually retinal reattachment retinal reattachment may sometimes predispose you to glaucoma find a good retina specialist good luck
282,breast pain please get a referral to a gynecologist
283,fibroadenoma near ducts nipple commonly bleed cannot be sure it is fibroadenoma even with two priors needs excision
284,must treat probably ra sets off an alarm you must find out if it is rheumatoid arthritis ra as ra is a treatable disease that can lead to deformity and disability if not promptly treated the best doctor to see is a rheumatologist
285,an overgrowth of your own bacteria or another infection but portably deserves a check
286,check it out see your doc probably bacterial over growth
287,check your pill pack please check your pill pack to make sure you have not missed any pills missing your pills will increase your chances of getting pregnant and also making your periods irregular if you have not missed any pills  then you will not get pregnant as long as you have taken your pills on time daily if you continue to have irregular periods on your third pack  please contact your doctor
288,test a week later repeat pregnancy test a week later
289,either way either option is acceptable if you stop the pill or take the sugar pill then you are withdrawing from hormones and this will trigger a menstrual cycle if you continue taking them the birth control will regulate you eventually
290,yes please just continue into your next pack for maximum protection
291,most likely ok as long as you havent missed any pills  and your pregnancy test is negative  i wouldnt worry keep taking your pills as scheduled some women will skip  dont have menses or have very light scant flow on the newer lo dose pills if you get any symptoms of pregnancy though  do another pregnancy test or check in with your doctor and get a blood pregnancy test
292,bcp certain pills will cause you not to have period
293,possibly nothing in life is 100% even the best contraception can fail there is no way to know if you are pregnant without the proper examination and laboratory testing there are other factors that can cause you to miss or have a lighter bleeding i would suggest seeing a gynecologist if you have further questions or concerns
294,no guessing here doctors never guess when it comes to pregnancy please get a pregnancy test
295,yes    you could fortunately or unfortunately  depending on your goals  sex can cause a pregnancy the best thing to do is take a test if the last time you had unprotected sex was more than 23 weeks ago  then the test should be accurate
296,unprotected sex puts one at risk for pregnancy
297,birth control pills in order to skip avoid having a period  in addition to not taking sugar pills  you also have to immediately start taking next months active pills so at no time are you off active pills this is concept behind extended cycle brands like seasonale  seasonique as for discharge  yoll need to see your familydoc  gyn or planned parenthood as birth control pills dont prevent stds stis
298,only if having sex and missed pill or on abx
299, didi you just continue to the next pack without a period if so could be your body just trying to make up for missed period
300,no missing just 1 pill in the 3rd week and then having sex in the placebo week should not place you at risk for pregnancy you can also use a condom to be extra safe
301,breakthrough bleedin breakthrough bleeding can occur with missing a pill and may show up as a brown discharge you should not be ovulating if you are taking your pills regularly if you are concerned about pregnancy  take a urine test barrier contraception with the pills will increase protection
302,unlikely  but a urine pregnancy test  done correctly  gives a reliable result 3 weeks after sex 3 weeks after when conception might have occurred  or 1 week after missing a period if done sooner  a positive result is likely real  but a negative result may be due to testing too soon  and thus lead to a repeat test
303,could be imbalance of estrogen and progesterone as well as old  leftover blood and tissue that needed to be expelled from the uterus take care
304,know your options the cause of the late periods is not something we can always answer there are lots of treatment options you can discuss with your doctor a late period from time to time is not unusual some benefit from birth control pills  patch or nuvaring mirena iud can stop your period in some cases
305,unlikely  late and irregular periods are very common in young women such as yourself dysfunctional uterine bleeding dub often results from hormonal imbalances during the menstrual cycle if you are taking oral contraceptives  they should help continue using reliable contraception if you miss another period  discuss with your doctor good wishes:
306,ocp side effects your symptoms are probably related to the pills is this your first cycle of contraception it is quite common to experience these side effects in moderation  but if they continue or worsen  you should consult your gynecologist for advice

478,call ur surgeon call the oral surgeon that you have scheduled the extractions with they should be able to prescribe the meds necessary to make you comfortable  but it would be even better if you can be seen earlier than in a few weeks feel better soon
479,manage right away if you are having muscle issues  you have time to get that figured out if it is your heart  damage that may be permanent is occuring as we speak heart disease isvthe number 1 killer of women because it is underdiagnosed so much and wonen sometimes hesitate to get proper attn your doc can irder a stat  emergency blood test that alab can do to differentiate if it is your heart or not doit now
480,have it checked it could be anything ranging from a tmj syndrome  to referred pain pattern from an atlas bone fascial restriction in your neck  to tension headache  and needs to be evaluated physically see a osteopathic do doctor  who can do an osteopathic exam on you to check your head  neck  spine  extremities  sacrum to find the cause s he can treat you too  or image if needed  or refer to dentist
481,your medical doctor you have general nonspecific symptoms start with your md  and take it from there
482,breathing pain pain like this can be related to a number of different things e g pneumothorax  muscle strain  malpositioned rib it would be wise to see your doctor who can evaluate this pain in conjunction with your medical history
483,pleuritic or muscle sounds like pleuritic type of pain  caused when the lungs are hyperexpanded you probably need at least a chest xray to see the lungs and chest it is common in pleuresy other possibilities are muscle strain or tension secondary to exercise  bad positions  sleeping bad etc  muscle contractions  check with your dr
484,pain in one leg can be something like an abscess or skin muscle infection  can be tendonitis  can be cystic structure it would be important to see what the ultrasound did find as opposed to what it did not find typically if not improving with antiinflammatory or pain medication need to explore other options
485,very unlikely to be with a negative ddimer yore more likely to be suffering from muscle spasms  particularly given your symptoms of charlie horse knot if your symptoms do not resolve with adequate hydration  warm compresses  light massage  and other soothing measures  see your doctor for diagnosis and treatment
486,more info if ultrasound negative unlikely dvt any associated symptomsswelling  etc
487,not likely doppler ultrasound is very accurate at detecting deep venois thrombi
488,unusual 30 s female w pain in sciatic region of thigh asks whether is blood clot this is unusual region for blood clot if is blood clot would expect swelling of leg  pain elicited by direct pressure on region  when tense leg flexor muscles against resistance that said  these sympmptoms in someone who already had leg blood clot causes all bets off  and doctor and ultrasound are probably indicated
489,possibly you mentioned another blood clot  i am assuming yove had one before if so  it is possible that yove had another one secondly  could be stretched hamstring or muscle strain lastly  if all is negative then consider a spine issue as a possibility that may need further evaluation
490,yes and no while any set of symptoms can be misdiagnosed  the most prominent symptom from dvt isnt pain  in fact  its often painless its swelling especially unilateral swelling  swelling of one leg and not the other id look for another cause of your pain leg pain can be referred can spread from the back  hip  and knee and theyre the most likely culprits calf cramps are common and not due to dvt
491,no if the ultrasounds are negative you do not have a dvt
492,unlikely to have dvt many causes of leg pain be examined and perhaps have duplex ultrasound depending on physical findings
493,unlikely get some blood work to check your potassium and magnesium levels 
494,not likely all your studies suggest no dvt pain is pretty constant from dvt until some treatment is given i favor musculoskeletal pain accounting for symptoms
495,unsure you can have a dvt without having any pain at all  and the pain can be intermittent but  very reassuring that the ddimer and ultrasound tests were negative you can also watch the size of the calf that is hurting measure it with tape measure compared to opposite leg at same level if it is bigger  then it might be worth repeating the ultrasound but it sounds like something else is the cause
496,absolutely  although it is less likely at your age without knowing your history  in addition to immobility  i would mention birth control pills  smoking or an inherited hypercoagulable state would also increase your risk any recent surgical intervention would also raise the risk twitching is not a specific symptom  but the sensation of a heavy leg and the location raise concern ultrasound would be the first test
497,constant calf cramp i am glad you did the ultrasound  but i would still get a complete vascular workup from a vascular surgeon the 2 common causes of this cramping that is common is blood clot and referred pain from the sciatic nerve see a neurologist  physiatrist  orthopod  or chiropractor to check on the sciatic nerve coming off your back dr rich blake
498,dvt less likely your symptoms are due to musculoskeletal disorder
499,no not with a negative ultrasound any edema notes on ultrasound could be lymphatics or local tissue injury too
500,leg pain the pain you describe is not typical for dvt  it sounds more like a musculoskeletal symptom having said that  one cant be sure whats going on from out here and it would be a safer course to see your dr and get checked
501,nerve or muscule depending on the location and character of the pain this could be related to sciatica or pinched nerve in the low back or due to a musculoskeletal cause ie muscles or ligaments in the abscence of swelling increased warmth  or redness a dvt is less likely
502,go to er your intuition sounds correct to me please get checked in the er where they can check a ddimer for pulmonary emboli and a spiral ct to localize chest lesions and an u s to check for deep venous thrombosis this is a true medical emergency please let me know the outcme
503,why no ultrasound if your leg is swollen or has a painful cord you might have a blood clot that said you doctor should be able to examine you to evaluate for joint pain or other sources
504,needs evaluation it is impossible to say if your symptoms are due to a pulmonary embolism you certainly need to be reevaluated 85% of pes come from the leg veins an ultrasound done in july is not useful with new symptoms i would repeat the venous ultrasound and you may also require a chest ct your symptoms may not at all be related to a pe see your medical doctor
505,seek medical care suggest ct angio which will definatively r o pe and possibly dx any other chest diseases
506,see md dont mess around with this you need to be seen immediately a pe and heart attack can cause these symptoms  as well as others
507,follow up mgt an ultrasound is quite accurate as a screening tool if you develop any symptoms or continue to have pain  further evaluation is indicated any respiratory problems should be reported to your doctor immediately try to avoid nsaids if you can
508,see below it all depends if someone is high risk or low risk for a dvt in your case someone that is young  it is unlikely that you had a dvt unless you had a predisposing event for such like malignancy  blood disorder  history of dvt  broken bones etc  when the likelihood is low  a ddimer is very sensitive and will likely rule out possibility if suspicion is high > ultrasound will help
509,leg pain the pain you describe is not typical for dvt  it sounds more like a musculoskeletal symptom having said that  one cant be sure whats going on from out here and it would be a safer course to see your dr and get checked
510,nerve or muscule depending on the location and character of the pain this could be related to sciatica or pinched nerve in the low back or due to a musculoskeletal cause ie muscles or ligaments in the abscence of swelling increased warmth  or redness a dvt is less likely
511,most likely not dvt pain mostly in the calf because that where the deep vein is  if you are having a pain around your varicoses vein it could be your superfical veins not your deep one to be sure get venous doppler to ruled out the dvt
512,call your doc would recommend venous doppler even tho ddimer normal
513,dvt in pregancy if i understand your q correctly use lovenox for dvt treatment during pregnancy coumadin is contraindicated as it has terotogenic effect see your local hematologist for special guidance for management of dvt during pregnancy and delivery
514,leg pain could be sciatica  bakers cyst  synovial cyst   femoral acetabular impingement syndrome if athletic or iliotibla band though that is usually lateral pain syndrome hernias usually cause groin upper thigh pain but pain has unusual distributions may also be from intracranial htn discuss with you doctor  ask if nsaids neurontin  lyrica may help if from nerve involvment
515,sciatica although there are several possibilities  one if the more common causes is a sciatica  which is an irritation of a nerve in the back that can cause pain that runs into the hip when you lower your chin  it increases the pressure in the spinal canal and can aggravate the symptoms like you are describing the hip and the si joint are also potential causes dont hesitate to be seen
516,doubtful swelling would be expected if dvt was present  tight muscles may respond to guided stretching
517,unlikely a blood clot is unlikely in your situation however if yove had a long car ride or plane ride one is possible if you have any concerns i would see your physician about having an ultrasound done as it is a very safe and relatively inexpensive test without any radiation to easily diagnose a blood clot
518,etiology you should be trying to discover the etiology for the clot make sure your medical team is aware of all the medicines you are taking  and any otc products that you are using they will be looking to try to determine if there is a predisposition for recurrence  and give you advice on what to do in the future to avoid recurrence
519,whatever you like why did it happen are you taking bcp did you recently have surgery like c section how can you prevent future occurrence how long the treatment will last where is dvthow far up in the lower extremity what are some of the risk and symptoms you need to look out for what drug and food should be avoided or taken 
520,doppler and legs very accurate there are a million other reasons for pain why do you think you have a dvt
521,its a possibility and because it is you should rule it out immediately better safe than sorry
522,not likely the description is not consistent with dvt  and a negative ddimer makes it very unlikely that you have a deep vein thrombus
523,no dvt as a rule do not occur on the front of the leg this pea sized area could be a small node if located on the front of the leg if there is pain and redness it needs treatment ans see your doctor if over the knee cap itself it could be a case of bursitis please see your doctor soon and do not open this up or manipulate this
524,unlikely risk factors that increase the chance of blood clot include sitting for long periods of time low blood flow  smoking  having personal or family history of clots  birth control or pregnancy  inflammatory diseases eg crohns or rheumatoid arthritis the only way to know for sure is by ultrasound if the pain on the left worsens or swelling begins to occur  then reasonable to see a physician
525,reassuring given history of factor v leiden and prior dvt  it is important to take leg pains seriously ultrasound with doppler is very good at detecting even small blood clots in the calf and thigh given your lab and doppler findings  doubtful your pain is coming from a new dvt the symptoms may be musculoskeletal or could possibly be related to superficial veins though they should have checked on us
526,need follow up ultrasound in 47 days
527,missed period usually patients bring us questions rather than just making a statement here on health tap you failed to ask a question but it sounds like you have an irregular cycle this month and given that you bled are going to normalize like most other women who have a missed cycle
528,period it is likely your period missing one ocp is not going to cause you to ovulate  missing pills repeatedly will your period is due  it is likely your period
529,dysfunctional bleed we call this dysfunctional uterine bleeding any chance of pregnancy if so  recommend home pregnancy test on first morning urine if neg  repeat in 710 days if both neg unlikely you are pregnant and this is a miscarriage if this continues for another 35 days  will need to see your gyn provider for evaluation and treatment hope this was helpful best of luck with this dr r
530,ovary failure you have amenhorrhea  or anovulation your ovaries have failed it is past time to get to the doctor to figure out why and how to get them back to normal
531,see answer even with an ectopic pregnancy  your test would should be showing signs of pregnancy however  if your pain persists  you need to let your dr know so other causes can be sought and then the proper diagnosis and treatment will hopefully follow  best wishes
532,no home pregnancy tests are very sensitive a month after your withdrawal bleed  with no exposure to semen  it would be extremely unlikely you are pregnant to say nothing of your stated sex as male
533,dont know not enough information you may want to schedule a check upvwith your gynto investigate the cramps and spotting
534,could be pregant anytime you have unprotected sex  you risk pregnancy   worse lifelong disease a change in the pattern of your period then could indicate pregnancy  sometimes disease too do a pregnancy test   get checked for sexually transmitted disease if you do not wish either of these things  practice safe sexif the possibility of pregnancy exists  act as if pregnant  and avoid drugs  tobacco  alcohol
535,no blood in the urine does not affect pregnancy test  check for uti or threatened abortion due to spotting after a missed period
536,birth control pills you should not be having so many side effects from the birth control pills call your doctor or see a specialist to see what your options are to birth control without so many side effects
537,several if not pregnant  you cannot have ectopic pregnancy what other signs pain can come from lots of things  pelvic infection  urinary tract infection  ovarian cysts etc pelvic exam with gyn is best bet
538,pregnant ectopic repeat home test for pregnancy if you have ectopic pregnancy  the test should be positive you should call your doctor to be examined for your abdominal pain  as there are many possibilities for the cause
539,test in a week do another test in a week if + see your ob
540,implantation if you have had unprotected sex  there could be spotting due to implantation if pregnant when the embryo implants into the uterine wall it can cause pink discharge  brown discharge or sometimes small amounts of red blood in white secretions it is appropriate to take a pregnancy test since you missed your period
541,pregnancy test get a pregnancy test whichever way it turns out make an appointment with your ob gyn catch up with your female health good luck
542,don’t guess take a test  they are the same tests used in a doctors office they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period  if you doubt the result you can repeat it in 12 days if you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection
543,too early to say your symptoms may represent mittelschmerz  or cramping pain symptoms that occur at ovulation pregnancy is another issue  and depends on when you had unprotected sex during this same time period you are referring to pregnancy tests wont be effective until 2 weeks after you missed your period hope that helps
544,retest retest and see a doc either way
545,sprintec amp spotting spotting can occur with bcp but bcp are not foolproof so would check blood hcg x 2 1 week apart and possibly sonogram if still concerned
546,delayed period is most probably what you have and the light spotting appears to be your period pregnancy tests are usually pretty accurate you can repeat it if you have any doubts your symptoms appears to be due to your late period take care
547,here are some  in doubt  do hpt and repeat it in 1 wk if the 1st test is negative and clinically still suggesting pregnancy if this clinical scenario is new to you  see gyndoc to make sure if the blood is from vagina or the urine of course  confirm no uti so  collect  bring the info on onset  degree  progress   possible gurelated sx to doc for analysis  physicals  tests as needed so to deduce dx for rx
548,could be pregnant always need to think of pregnancy if you are a sexually active young female even though it might seem as a menstrual bleed
549,irregular cycle there are many causes of irregular cycle pregnancy is always a possibility vaginitis yeast or other can cause bleeding and brown discharge hormone irregularities can also interfere with normal cycles i recommend keeping a menstrual chart and if still irregular in 2 months you need to consult a physician
550,possibly there are several causes of missed periods and pregnancy is always number one however  stress  hormone imbalance  anatomy changes can all contribute to change in cycles i recommend repeating pregnancy test in one week  if negative  consult your physician
551,possibly depends even if you have a negative hpt  a missed period is considered pregnancy until proven otherwise you also might have an ectopic pregnancy  which is an emergency it would be wise to see you doctor to find out for sure why you missed your period  as stress can be a cause  and whether or not yore pregnant have ectopic pregnancy best of luck
552,spotting irregular periods are common in some people in addition get a pregnancy test too
553,no this is not normal does not sound like you are pregnant could be an underactive thyroid see your doctor to find out
554,no i think all the tests you have had confirm you are not pregnant take care
555,possible please check with home pregnancy test
556,actually for most laboratories a beta hcg level of five or less is actually equivalent to zero thats just how the lab test works iduring processing
557,missed menses if you have already missed your period  then a pregnancy test would be appropriate
558,yes frequency of urination  painful voiding  and occasionally fever can all be present wih a bladder infection even if there is no blood in the urine in fact  while there can be blood associated with a uti  most of the time there is no complaint of blood in the urine  but burning and frequency is usually present
559,unprotected sex any time you have unprotected sex you are at risk fir pregnancy if you have missed a period get a home pregnancy test and check
560,they are  but wait until you miss your period  as some women get these symptoms when not pregnant too if you miss your period then check the urine preg test best wishes
561,pregnancy the symptoms you noted may be a sign of pregnancy if you had unprotected sex however  these symptoms may also be premenstrual symptoms  your period may be arriving in the next 2448 hours if you miss a period and had unprotected sex  take a pregnancy test
562,could be you can also take a pregnancy test to make certain
563,possible this could be pregnancy but i cant say without knowing more about your menstrual cycle and use of contraception a pregnancy test could help sort this out
564,pregnancy signs you may be pregnant do home pregnancy tests to find out they are very reliable if pregnant   call your doctor
565,maybe  but why guess about it you can take a pregnancy test now using a first morning void take care
566,no most likely a sign of a yeast infection see your doctor for treatment take care
567,variable there are a lot of questions like this  and my answer is always the same the only truly reliable sign of pregnancy is a late period and a positive pregnancy test tests are so inexpensive that if one is concerned one should just buy one and see
568,not necessary you need to give us more information regarding your menstruation in order to answer your question accurately
569,no at your age  very unlikely to have coronary muscle spasm your heart is normal  unless i am not aware of a heart condition however most likely this is an intercostal or rib pain in the area also could be do to muscle spasm as well
570,unlikely does not sound like typical heart pain but one should have more history age  duration  circumstances of the production of the pain  other medical conditions etc  
571,kidding you are asking doctors to guess without sharing any menstrual  sexual  or more importantly ovulatory history
572,major depression is a mood disorder lasting a minimum of two weeks depressive sxs may include low mood  isolating from others  irritability  anger  ^ or v sleep  change in appetite  feelings of helplessness or hopelessness  v energy  v selfesteem  feelings of guilt v motivation  absence of joy v concentration  v memory  suicidal thoughts one may have an anxious depression recommend psychiatric eval to know
573,testing timely although all described symptoms may be lumped together as a result of pregnancy  but  not always to be real  give symptomatic care to cope with acid reflex  breast sore   frequency also do pregnancy in 23 weeks after missing the expected period if still in doubt  see your doc timely best wish
574,time for a test certainly
575,no need to guess if you are having sex  it is possible that you are pregnant although your symptoms are often found with pregnancy  they are not specific if you want to know if you are pregnant  wait until you miss your period and take a pregnancy test
576,depends on your age at best  women under 30 have a 3325% chance of conceiving if they have unprotected sex during the ovulation zone conception also depends on several other factors  as well
577,pregnant your tests indicate that you are pregnant but very early i suspect your doctor will want to repeat your hormone levels to confirm they are rising a progesterone greater than 25 is really good
578,yes yes
579,maybe maybe not it can be hard to tell if a woman is pregnant because some of the symptoms seen in early pregnancy can also happen in nonpregnant women a urine pregnancy test gives a reliable result if done correctly one can test about 3 weeks after sex 3 weeks after when conception might have occurred  or 1 week after missing a period an obgyn doctor can evaluate any persistent or worrisome symptoms
580,take a preg test could be need to know when your last period was and last unprotected sex take a urine pregnancy test to be sure
581,could be could you be pregnant if so if check a pregnancy test 
582,gyn exam the cramps are probablyb related to your period the itchyness and soreness probably need to be evaluated by a vaginal exam and testing for infection and treated
583,see your doctor you should be examined you can use warm soaks in the tub for some temporary relief
584,migraine a migraine is a common type of headache that may occur with symptoms such as nausea  vomiting  dizziness  changes in vision  numbness  tingling or sensitivity to light in many people  a throbbing pain is felt only on one side of the head some people who get migraines have warning symptoms  called an aura  before the actual headache begins
585,sure  as well as lots of things particularly if symptoms persist  get evaluated in the meantime   to reassure either way  check a home pregnancy test now
586,very possibly if you had unprotected sex and semen was deposited into the vagina  you may be the best way to answer that question is to either see a doctor or use a home pregnancy test kit if you are able to pick one up at the pharmacy you could have delayed menses if you have recently been travelling  but in young women  the most common explanation for a week long delay in the menstrual cycle is pregnancy
587,maybe do a home preg test if negative you are not if positive you likely are
588,call doctor i understand your anxiety the best way to know if your girl friend is pregnant is to request that her doctor orders a blood pregnancy test
589,lymph nodes hello  this sounds like you have some lymph node that are swollen or inflamed if this is the case  it can be the sign of an infection or other process going on this should be evaluated by your physician if the lumps are in the breast tissue and not actually in the armpit  they could be cysts or a different mass of the breast in any case  get seen and make sure all is well
590,please see your gyn must r o pregnancy and u need other blood work and an ultrasound for diagnosis and then can get the proper txment
591,take the test if you want to know if you are pregnant  take a test in todays world you do not need to wonder if you are pregnant or not based on symptoms pregnancy tests are available at any pharmacy and in minutes you will have your answer they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period
592,pregnant these are all vague complaints and could be associated with pregnancy but the number one sign is not having a period go buy a pregnancy test and see your doctor to talk about birth control
593,need more info did you use contraception did you do a home pregnancy test if you did and it was negative redo it because your symptoms are very suggestive of pregnancy if still no period  still have negative test please see your ob gyn very soon
594,nonot safe seroquel is a class c drug and has been known to cause harm to the fetus trazedone also is not safe  is a class c drug  and may cause harm they should be used only if the benefits outweigh the possible harm they are not safe  and risks are clearly present for birth defects  miscarriages  and for trazedone  the drug can pass to the newborn through breast milk
595,side effects you dont get pregnant on depo and you dont get pregnant without sperm you have to be smarter than this in the material you got with your depo these extremely common side effects are very legibly laid out for you this is how many females feel on depo
596,yes see doc yes you should  and with the pelvic pain  you should see a doctor and get a sonogram if you are pregnant to make sure it is not an ectopic pregnancy
597,2 weeks two weeks
598,penicillin is not #1 penicillin is not useful in chlamydial infections so you shouldnt worry but prevention condom is the best way to keep from needing recurring cycles of antibiotics please discuss with your doctor
599,yes there are several antibiotic options for treating chlamydia infections a primary care doctor can review the options for a patient  especially if the patient has some antibiotic allergies prevention is the best way to avoid needing antibiotics for chlamydia
600,fp im gyn uc most primary care physicians can perform this testingusually a vaginal culture or urine testing
601,see gyn this requires a pelvic exam see your gynecologist best wishes
602,chlamydia chlamydia is treated with antibiotics it is often treated with one dose of azithromycin or doxycycline twice a day for seven days people with chlamydia should abstain from sexual intercourse for seven days after either treatment  to prevent spreading the infection to partners
603,see specialist and get their opinion on your specific situation
604,acne scars vs lasers very hard to tell via the internet best to seek in person examinations from a term doing laser therapies
605,see doctor most sore throats and colds are caused by viruses which do not respond to antibiotics but sometimes they are caused by bacterial infections ie: strep throat  staph infections which need to be treated with antibiotics the doctor can take a throat culture which will help to identify if you have a bacterial infection and require antibiotics
606,that is correct  taking 1 gram azythromycin orally is a good choice for its convenience and effectiveness although doxycycline or tetracycline hcl or erythromycin may be used but  do need to treat the partner simultaneously with timely f u and practice safe sex to prevent recurrence
607,probably unnecessary a single 1g dose of azithromycin is highly effective and there should be no need for a second dose even if reexposed to an infected partner  azithro remains in the system for 10 days or more  so you would be protected from reinfection it can take more than 7 days for symptoms to clear  so give it time if symptoms actually are worse  dont treat yourself but return to doctor for reevaluation
608,oh my gosh  couldnt that cause pain rather than douching  would encourage you to treat the infection instead
609,yes you can drink alcohol while taking the drugs used to treat chlamydia
610,highly variable this depends upon the extent of damage to your liver  the duration of your alcoholism and the underlying state of your liver to begin with on top of that  if you are going to be using the alt and ast values improving as a reason to begin drinking again  this is of no value chronic hepatic damage leading to cirrhosis can occur with minimal elevations of enzymes or none at all
611,it depends anyone who drinks heavily 6pack of beer  a bottle of wine  or pint of liquor a day may develop abnormally high liver enzymes alt and ast it means the alcohol made your liver fill up with fat  and its not working right the same thing can happen if yore obese stopping drinking usually resolves the enzyme elevations in 14 weeks  but sometimes it means your liver has been damaged permanently
612,pain during sex lets talk about nonmedical causes was it rougher type sex you had or was your partner not gentle enough could your partners member been too large for you its not just infection that could have caused the pain and bleeding  you know
613,improve  not remove scars are permanent having said that  there are ways to make them less noticeable the first is time: scars mature over 618 months and dont assume their final form till then other methods are pressure  silicone sheeting  mederma  steroid injections or surgery surgery is a last resort for most scars  but many can be improved in this way if all else fails
614,pregnancy a blood test called a beta suibunit hcg can immediately determine if you are pregnant and whether the hormone levels are normal
615,psychotherapy psychotherapy is the usual way to investigate emotional problems
616,yeast the chlamydia has been treated but you very likely may also have or gotten a yeast infection given you took an antibiotic
617,lemon balm melissa officinalis or lemon balm cream has been shown in european studies to help expedite healing of cold sores no moneyback guarantee
618,for some it is helpful for some people but not all works best in combination with other treatments  especially if there is some degree of patella maltracking or instability
619,50 50 braces may help with subluxation of the patella j sleeve type of brace for run of the mill chondromalacia patella  treatment consists of activity modification  therapy  antiinflammatory meds braces in this population may provide some benefit i tell my patients to try one on  take it for a test drive around the office and if you like it  then give it a shot
620,dont bother it wont work if somebody or some superstition is denying you access to scientific treatment for acne  then you have my sympathy any licensed physician knows how to make it vanish
621,can treat immediately and wouldnt wait for it to become overwhelming if topical otc ineffective after 2 days contact your doctor for oral antifungal
622,probably you dont know you have a staph infection you dont know if you even have an infection  much less the exact bacteria which might be causing it and physicians are here to help you but it remains a business which requires money to operate so if you have an infection which requires antibiotics  go and see a doctor b c if you become septic from an untreated infection  you could die
623,exact mls not important iif you use the applicator just fill it one applicator is about 2  5 ml
624,need more info i would suggest that you take the oral form a tablet instead of a vaginal gel if that does not do the trick after a week then look for another cause of your infection because flagyl the brand name of the antibiotic you are using is not curing the infection if it is an infection
625,no ineffective against chlamydia
626,23 days to 6 weeks chlamydia and gonorrhea testing is valid any time more than 23 days after the last exposre syphilis blood tests take 46 weeks to become positive
627,std testing it differs for syphilis the test would not be valid until about six weeks after exposure gonorrhea and chlamydia testing should or could be done within the first week after exposure
628,23 days to 6 weeks chlamydia and gonorrhea testing is valid any time more than 23 days after the last exposre syphilis blood tests take 46 weeks to become positive
629,no since the azithromycin is in your blood stream and therefore everywhere in your body you cant infect another prt of your body with chlamydia while on the antibiotics and the chlamydia should be gone by the time you finish the antibiotics hope this helps
630,no while yore taking azithromycin  its not possible to become infected with an organism that is sensitive to azithromycin it is possible to be infected with a different organism or an organism that has become resistant to azithromycin
631,none none of the above  but possibly one of the antibiotics
632,before you focus on supplementation  first consider seeing a physiatrist or orthopedic surgeon to determine a cause of your pain you may also want to consider having a certified personal trainer review your squatting technique
633,knee pain first of all stop squatting if the knee hurts fish oils and glucosamine are two that i recommend for joint pain
634,23 weeks if your infection responds to the antibiotics
635,7 days i assume you are referring to genital chlamydia infection as there are other types azithfromycin 1 gram given in 1 dose is the recommended treatment in most guidelines doxycycline 100mgs twice a day for 7 days would be an alternative do not use doxycyline if you might be pregnant
636,no not likely to be related however  if the symptoms persist  the dr treating your neck can probably address your new problem
637,could be  sciatica is a common presentation of a disc in the back with pain and numbness affecting the sciatic nerve the symptoms radiate from the back to the back of the leg and sometimes all the way to the foot
638,nerve disease in the absence of back pain the possibility of sciatic pain is low since symptoms are confined to foot and leg  a pinched nerve is more likely emg will help see a neurologist

640,see doctor this should certainly be examined it could be neuropathy
641,a couple of things this might be due to a peripheral neuropathy  compartment syndrome  blood clot  spinal issue or overuse see a doctor as soon as possible since it has been going on for 2 weeks and your symptoms sound significant
642,see a pain doc a disc is bulging because it loses elasticity  like a waistband in your underwear when it loses elasticity it no longer stays nice and tight and snug like it used to be if it bulges enough it can get close to the nerve and irritate it the inflammation and irritation can cause pain in the neck or shoulder blade as well as pain  numbness  tingling or weakness in your arm

645,maybe nerve at knee perineal nerve might be irritated at knee level if no weakness in foot or back pain id give it a couple weeks then see ortho doc if no better
646,multiple causes numbness  tingling in the toes has multiple causes in your case given your age  stress reaction if your md gave you a boot they think you probably have a stress fracturethe altered kinetics are probably causing your numbness or the boot itselfan emg will help you get the diagnosisthe same is true for your father grandmothermost causes of neuropathy can be determined w a neuro eval  emg
647,nerve or not a nerve what do you mean by a stress reaction if you are thinking about neuropathy  stop symptoms in two toes  on one side is not a sign of neuropathy perhaps you just irritated something by trauma thats common  and not serious there are ways to determine hereditary neuropathy  but for you  there is no need to do so
648,hit you head did you hit your head as well does the pain travel to the hand if you have chronic arm pain from the pinched nerve and this is now worse  then it is likely that you have inflamed that nerve again  the headache is more worrisome of a post concussive syndrome if you hit you head as well time to go see your doc
649,muscle twitches some irritation to a muscle  nerve  or part of a nerve that goes to certain muscle fibers may cause those fibers to twitch such twitching is usually for a few hours or a day  and only once in a while in those cases  doctors and patients usually dont spend time looking for a cause but  if symptoms are frequent  or recurrent  a primary doctor and neurologist can evaluate and look for the cause
650,mononeuritis multipl you have inflammation of multiple nerves   usually due to a virus mononeuritis multiplex i would see a neurologist
651,yes numbness and weakness in the right upper and lower extremities may indicate nerve compression at the level of the spine mri and emg could localize and prognosticate a compressive neuropathy and would give guidance to appropriate treatment options consult with a physical medicine and rehabilition specialist would be appropriate
652,2 nerves one pinched nerve cant cause numbness in arm and leg so look for other causes  or multiple levels of disease
653,prejaculate yes preejaculate seminal fluid or secretion contains some viable sperms
654,pregnancy it is possible for example some sexual partners will have intercourse and the male pulls out of the vagina before ejaculating thinking this would protect from a pregnancy however a good deal of sperm can be released into the vagina before ejaculation and cause an unwanted pregnancy

657,probpinched neeve this is a common scenario in back injury herniated lumbar disc may have occurred

664,yes see doctor
665,how old r symptoms if the leg symptoms were present before the laminectomy  i would not expect them to go away they are caused by nerve irritation if you had the numbness symptoms this long  they may not recover it has been longer than 18 months on the other hand  the burning probably will go away if the symptoms are not related to the laminectomy  then i would have to give a different answer
666,your question is  you stated some facts but did not ask a clear question the issue you mentioned is not uncommon you essentially got a spinal on one side rather than a simple epiduralsome women docs actually prefer it as it is easier to do technically it can take longer to get the feeling back but you should not have any long term complications if you have other  submit a new

764,likely ok  if tender this depends on if your lymph node is tender painful  as opposed to rock hard and painless if you had nothing else  and you had no swelling of your lymph node before now  and it is tender  it is likely an infection  and should resolve if nontender  and you have hoarse voice  nonhealing ulcer  etc  you might want to see your doctor soon and get a biopsy tests to rule out possible cancer  etc
765,need to see dentist you need to see a dentist and possibly be referred to an oral surgeon for diagnosis it may be an infection bacterial  viral or fungal  a tumor or a blocked salivary gland most of those would not change your blood test profiles  which are generally not diagnostic of dental problems you need to be examined and receive appropriate treatment or referral

770,symptoms of a pinch a pinched nerve can occur in an area that affects the arm and the shoulder often though  soreness is not the symptom suspicious symptoms would be numbness  tingling  or inability moving you arm a certain way  due to weakness was there an injury before these symptoms started muscle and tendon problems exist here also
771,probably the term cervical radiculopathy refers to symptoms that stem from a  pinched nerve in the neck your pain follows the c7 nerve pattern and so it very well could be the source of your symptoms an mri would be the test of choice to confirm the disgnosis
772,dry socket sounds like a dry socket see surgeon for packing and relief
773,maybe without other symptoms  cannot even try to offer a reasonable diagnosis but other options  diverticulitis  retrocecal appendicitis  pelvic or other bowel inflammatory disease  and interstitial cystitis come quickly to mind a careful abdominal and pelvic exam with a cbc and perhaps some other common tests will help to diagnose this
774,see answer though symptoms and u a may be suggestive  one cannot reliably make the diagnosis of a kidney stone without some type of an imaging study kub  ultrasound  ct with a noncontrast ct scan being the most accurate and reliable imaging study to determine the presence  location  and size approximation of a stone as well as to potentially rule out other causes of pain and hematuria
775,yes a ct scan will pick up most gallstones as well as thickening and swelling of the gallbladder and bile ducts the only thing a ct scan does a lousy job with is detecting if the gallbladder has a hard time emptying bile this can cause pain as well you need a hida scan to detect this
776,ct scan the ct scans you describe should pick up gall stones  maybe the radiologist is willing and nice enough to look at the films again
777,unlikely if you had an ultrasound that showed and intrauterine pregnancy the chance of you also having an ectopic is very very unlikely the pain at this gestational age would be constant
778,yes kidney stones do cause pain you should consult a urologist about treatment modalities available there is no need to live with the pain due to a treatable cause
779,alarm signs to check recurrent abdominal discomfort is first addressed by accompanying signs symptoms that may localize the organ involved: vaginal discharge or bleeding  alteration in periods  pregnancy risk fever  nausea  vomiting  altered stool pattern  blood w  stool  tenderness  distension painful urination  blood in urine recent trauma  herniations age risks if a lot of pain as described  get checked now
780,nonspecific your symptoms dont point towards a single diagnosis there are many possibilities  with the likely scenario not being dangerous since the symptoms are bad enough  make an appointment with your primary care provider asap if you can stay hydrated and are not running fevers  probably ok to wait until monday if not  head to urgent care or er hope this helps
781,not normal pain during intercourse is not normal if you know that you have endometriosis on the left ovary then this is the likely cause
782,gi consult  egd limited data available as reported colon cancer is rare at such an young age bright red blood usually from lower gi tract  or hemorrhoids  fissure etc however black stoll is concerning for upper gi bleed need a gi gastroenterology evaluation  egd upper endoscopy  h pylori testing  upper gi series etc contact pcp for gi referral go to a health tap doctor for a formal consult with more details

785,maybe sounds like your heart has been ruled out but other causes of dull chest pain include: gastroesophageal reflux  costochondritis  fibromyalgia  gastritis  peptic ulcer  nonulcer dyspepsia  myofascial syndrome and others your heart isnt the only possible cause of pain anxiety is a diagnosis of exclusion since there are no tests to confirm it as the cause
786,follow your doctors advice if white cells are low test should be repeated any way in few weeks
787,watery stools see your doctor to rule out possible gall bladder disease or a pregnancy

850,not ms recommend dental exam  as most likely this is a localized problem within your mouth  not a widespread brain disorder
851,likely neither  but not clear to me why you are taking a steroid  and mild tremors in legs are very nonspecific  as can be experienced in muscle fatigue after exertion prednisolone causes many side effects  but these leg sensations are not characteristic ms is a clinical diagnosis compiling many signs  symptoms  and imaging findings  and your complaints are too nonspecific to confirm ms

869,pain is subjective some people are very tolerant of pain from surgery and some are very pain sensitive some do great with pain control  some have a very difficult time getting a medication that controls their pain and does not make them nauseous most isolated mcl tears are not surgically repaired and heal with bracing pain associated with the repair really depends on the technique used on the repair
870,depends on ligament the knee has 4 main ligaments the mcl  and lcl usually heal on their own the acl and pcl do not they usually need surgery pcl tears that isolated do not usually need surgery depending on symptoms acl tears usually need surgery  unless the patient is a sedentary  older individual  or if the patient is a coper
871,cannot be done ligament is a tough structure that is beneath the skin and currently we dont have the ability to repair a torn ligament without surgery we can do minmially invasive laparoscopic surgery  but still considered surgery because it requires cutting piercing holes to insert the scopessee picture here but you may not need surgery at all if ligament is not essential consult doc good luck
872,not always pain from meniscal tears often settle down with therapy surgery only needed for continues pain or locking of the knee
873,usually if it is painful yes if it blocks your motion yes if you cant bend or straighten all the way yes if you are limiting your activity due to the pain or fear of pain  yes if your knee is swelling a lot  yes if it doesnt hurt or limit your activity then no

878,arthritis narrowing of the joint space on the medial side of the knee is usually the result of arthritis it may be hereditary  or it can be a result of loss of cartilage from prior surgery surgery may be required  based on how badly it bothers you
879,depends on ligament some ligament injuries will heal with non operative treatment this depends on which ligament and how severe an injury occurred the medial collateral and posterior cruciate ligaments may heal with protectice bracing for 46 weeks if they involve a partial tear and no other damage complete tearing of a ligament will often be associated with other knee damage mri can often tell
880,a torn acl is a specific diagnosis of the anterior cruciate ligament being torn in your knee you typically do an acl reconstruction to restore function to your knee the term knee reconstruction is a general term and could mean anything from ligament repair to cartilage restoration or even knee replacement and fracture fixation
881,extremely important physical therapy is crucial for full functional recovery after a total knee replacement i believe that therapy should start as soon as possible  ideally the day after your surgery physical therapy should include soft tissue mobilization  joint mobilization  and strengthening exercises finding a skilled physical therapist is key to a complete recovery after receiving your new knee joint
882,very important physiotherapy is extremely important to regain mobility and strength of the knee  as well as to look at the entire kinetic chain from the ankle to the pelvis low back for compensations that have occurred presurgery we believe therapy should start the day following surgery to reduce swelling and scar tissue formation and to strengthen the core and muscles of the leg
883,popping simple advice popping with no pain  no treatment needed popping with pain  needs further evaluation and treatment
884,popping knee consider meniscal tear  synovitis  chondrolysis  ligament tears  loose bodies  tight capsule
885,yes this is common after this type of surgery popping that causes no pain is benign and can be ignored sometimes popping originating at the knee cap is due to muscle atrophy and improper trackingthis will get better with physical therapy if you have concerns contact your surgeon
886,ask ur surgeon most surgeons have their own protocol 4 post op pain   u should b asking him her general things as elevate  ice  rest may help it depends how far out u r from ur surgery but dont b bashfull ask your surgeon for help
887,postop questions if i understand correctly  your knee is now popping what about pain swelling it sounds like you need follow up with your surgeon it is critical you make postoperative follow up with your surgeon to properly follow your progress  rehab and any complications that may arise
888,good candidate depends on the severity of the tear  but w  the failed conservative treatment that you describe pt  injections i would think that you are a good candidate for surgery while many options such as pt  injections may help relieve your symptoms  you are likely to have lifelong complications w  a torn meniscus such as arthritis you should see an orthopedist to help evaluate drmarkgallandcom
889,time will tell not everyone who has a meniscus tear needs surgery what happens to the meniscus if you dont do surgery is it will either get better and not bother you or it will interfere with your normal daily activities statistically  most meniscal tears dont heal if you can do what you need and want to do  delay surgery
890,quad tendinitis pain could be from quadriceps above knee cap or patellar tendonitis below knee cap try a knee strap or irritated early wear of the patella cartilage or the surface cartilage of the thigh bone that rubs against the patella behind knee captry knee sleeve with a cutout for knee cap avoid stairs  knee extension machines  deep knee squats  lunges etc try therapy  ice  advil alleve see ortho
891,arthritis return to ur surgeon for evaluation

893,knee instability if buckling of the knee is the only symptom your having with or even without pain  its not a common symptom of rheumatoid arthritis buckling is usually a result of some kind of internal derangement in the knee like a meniscus tear or acl tear i think if this is the only joint yore having problems with  the diagnosis of ra is highly unlikely  especially if its just buckling or giving way
894,likely arthritis hi  arthroscopic surgery to treat meniscus tear can vary greatly from young athletes with isolated tears and older patients with arthritis at 50 yrs old you may have some arthritis in your knee and arthroscopic surgery will usually not help much with that type of pain it is reserved to help with mechanical pain such as locking and catching you will need to discuss this with your orthopedic doc
895,yes yes it requires good local wound care clean it several times each day with hydrogen peroxide and cover and change bandaid regularly this is usually a stitch that is working its way to the surface check with your doctor and you may need antibiotics to help clear the area up
896,yes see your surgeon pus at a surgery site always potentially concerning it could be something relatively minor such as a buried absorbable stitch irritating the skin  or it could be a very serious problem of a deep infection in the joint only your surgeon should make that call and do it asap
897,knee instability depending on how long you were immobilized after surgery  you may have weakness in the affected limb knee and should be going to or have gone for physical therapy if it is still unstable  have a repeat mri to make sure the surgery was performed properly and that the ligament has healed properly
898,varies symptoms will likely stay the same or worsen over time arthritis can develop if there is a large tear causing friction within the joint if conservative treatment has failed  surgery is likely the only thing that will help
899,yes much better total knee replacement is made to reduce pain and improve function patients walk much better after recovering from a total knee than they did before total knee surgery most walk close to normal or normal once they have fully recovered
900,yes cetainly in my hands
901,balanced the acl is sacrificed if the pcl is torn a posterior stabilized prosthesis is used the mcl  lcl are balanced
902,repaired or replaced torn ligaments that lead to surgery are either repaired  replaced  or augmented repaired and supplemented with other tissue tissues commonly used for other than a repair include locally harvested tissue referred to as an autograft a hamstring or central third of a patellar tendon allograft tissues donated cadaveric tissue are more numerous with regards to tissue options discuss w  your md
903,varies if the removal is done by laparoscopy then recovery would usually be one or two down days  but if laparotomy a larger incision on the abdomen is performed then expect to not feel great for about a week or two
904,where is it treatment for dermoid cyst is complete surgical removal  preferably in one piece and without any spillage of cyst contents recovery is based on where the cyst is located
905,34 month it depend were the fracture is it about 34 month
906,variable need more information
907,12 weeks depending on the type of work done   sedentary jobs can return to work within a few days  active jobs may require a bit more time and babying sutures if used usually come out in 7 14 days so i recommend waiting till they come out it there is no associated knee problem arthritis the biggest hinderamnce to returning to work iws hte muscle weakness associated with the tear
908,depends depends on what the work is somewhere between 3 and 12 weeks should cover most everybody
909,could be infected depends on how recent scar is and if there has been any history of trauma but if the scar is from recent surgery i would definitely get someone to look at it to rule out infection
910,yes if with pain for a while  surgery may help

947,anovulatory cycle sometimes the ovary fails to release an egg and thereby produce needed hormones to regulate menstrual cycles this can be due to being overweight  a thyroid disorder  polycystic ovary disorder  or just because its important to rule out early pregnancy or a complication of pregnancy miscarriage or tubal pregnancy time to see your ob gyn
948,we always worry when we hear chest pain we are always worried about heart disease yes  your symptoms may be  and probably are  related to your gerd  but i recommend consultation asap
949,could be gerd but you need treatment if symptoms resolve with treatmentgreat if not further evaluation is warranted
950,symptoms sounds like you dont have what you decided you have why dont you discuss with the doc you saw out here we dont know more about you than that doc does
951,musclar or cardiac get an keg
952,symptoms in a 25year old female your symptoms are far more likely to be gerd and esophageal than they are cardiac
953,yes try another two weeks  get tested for helycobacter pylori i assume you had gastroscopic procedure
954,gerd gerd is a chronic problem omeprazole generally has to be taken long term sometimes other medicines also a gastroenterologist should be able to help you
955,heart condition chest pain on the left side with numbness in the left arm and dizziness could possiblys signal a medical emergency at the worst  this could be an impending heart attack at best  it could be angina which is still a heart condition that could lead to worse outcomes including death my suggestion  visit your local er if this continues to occur
956,heart attack depending on your personal and family medical history and age  you may be having a heart attack classic signs are sweating  nausea  shortness of breath  leftsided chest pain  numbness and tingling of the left arm women may experience heartburn symptoms only other causes could be lung  gallbladder  chest muscles  nerve impingement problems you need evaluation asap at an emergency room
957,thanks for asking call 911 or go to the er this is serious
958,not likely headache is certainly one of the common symptoms of a brain tumor  but chest pain is not usually in any way related you may just have migraines  or you may have another type of disease you should see your doctor for evaluation and appropriate testing and referral  probably to a neurologist who specializes in headache an mri of the head would help
959,without without an indepth history and physical  it is impossible to know what are causing your headaches headaches and their causes can be complicated  difficult diagnoses to make you should make an appointment with your doctor for a complete evaluation your doctor will take a thorough history and do a neurological evaluation to try and find out what is causing your symptoms you may want to think about the answers to some of the questions they may ask you such as:  when did it start  how often do they happen  are they getting more frequent or more painful  how long do they last  what does the headache feel like and can you point to it  does it occur around the same time at night or does it ever happen during the day  what other symptoms do you have and when do they occur in regards to the headache  have you had any big life changes  how is your lifestyle are you getting enough sleep  eating well  exercising  are you taking any medications do you drink caffeine and how much answering these questions may help your doctor figure out what is causing your headaches  whether it is a serious problem or not  and how to help you good luck
960,not sure your symptoms are nonspecific enough that it is difficult to tell for sure what is going on just from your short description if you do know you already have gerd  i would try taking a liquid antacid such as mylanta when you get these symptoms  just to see if it helps temporarily if it does  did you know that the problem is likely to be acid related if they persist  see your gi doctor
961,panic symptoms like heart attacks shortness of breath  heart palpitations  sweating  etc with normal ecg learn2relax your breathing practice when u r not having a panic attack so that when it occurs u will be prepared2use the relaxed breathing2calm yourself at the same time remind yourself  it will pass  u r not having a heart attack or other physical problem therapists can teach u other relaxation techniques
962,pins and needles you need to see a doctor as soon as possible for a neurological evaluation
963,chest pain among the many possible causes of chest pain are inflammation of muscles or cartilage  reflux of stomach contents  lung disease and heart disease  the latter two including blood clot in the lung and heart attack best to see your doctor for complete examination sudden onset of chest pain warrants emergency evaluation
964,fold in the pleura texidors twinge if this feels like its a stabbing pain and worse when you breathe in  this is fairly common and utterly trivial i believe its the result of a fold in the pleural membrane fill your lungs with as much air as possible and it vanishes or this may be some other minor pleural or other chest wall problem if yore not short of breath or suffering palpitations  yore ok
965,chest pain you dont need to have an abnormal blood pressure in order to demonstrate you are having heart problems many people who suffer heart attacksfor example appear with normal blood pressure however it is certainly true that those that suffer of high blood pressure have a higher risk for heart issues if you are in doubt and having chest pain go and see your doctor as soon as possible
966,not really but  historically a pressure type retrosternal chest pain associated with activities and better with rest is typical for angina but as we get older and with female diabetic patients  less typical become typical i take chest pain very seriously  specially if associated with chd risk factors evaluation asap
967,center of chest uncomfortable pressure  squeezing  fullness or pain in the center of chest it lasts more than few minutes  or goes away and comes backwomen are more likely than men to experience shortness of breath  nausea vomiting and back or jaw painother signs such as breaking out in a cold sweat  nausea or lightheadedness  pain or discomfort in one or both arms
968,undiagnosed pain you describe undiagnosed chest pain this should be evaluated in all cases the only other information we have is that yore male and 29 the incidence of coronary disease with those demographics is very low depending on other risk factors  surely
969,er shortness of breath and chest pain need to be seen in the er or at least urgent care best not to delay you need a cxr  exam  labwork
970,pleuritic chest pain your described symptoms certainly sound like pleuritic pain
971,workup mgt these symptoms may be related to gastroesophageal reflux gerd  especially given the relationship between the pain and eating if there is bleeding with the pain  ulcerative disease is unlikely other causes though are possible  and i would recommend seeing your physician
972,chest pains pain in your chest is a serious medical condition it is always a red flag and appointment with your pcp is warranted rec: see your pcp for further investigation take care
973,pulls and pleurisy the usual explanation in someone your age is a simple strain of an intercostal muscle  but inflammation of the linings around the heart or lung can cause this as well you havent specified what type of pain  but i suppose some injury to the ribs and or cartilage could do it as well see your doc to discuss
974,several possibles musculoskeletal from any trauma pulmonary pneumothorax lung inflammation pneumonia pleurisy pulmonary embolism cardiac
975,mononeuritis multipl you have inflammation of multiple nerves   usually due to a virus mononeuritis multiplex i would see a neurologist
976,many possibilities this could be related to your congenital heart disease you need to get a complete cardiac workup and see a cardiologist
977,ekg interpretation ok  you are in the er  you have a congenital heart disease you are not having a heart attack  so at this point listen to the er doc and look into other reasons for your abdominal pain as far as the ekg  the rad prob is a reflection of the chd but you probably need a cardiologist to review it and determine if it means anything
978,usually not pain is more related to chest and mid abdomen quality of pain burning type does not radiate to neck  elbow or arms or shoulder
979,it can but without sitting down and talking with you it is a loaded question please see your doctor to discuss asap
980,could be that could be serious the most troublesome thing you said is that you have chest pain in the center undiagnosed chest pain in a 47 year old who reports  as you do  a history of angina  should be further evaluated  especially if its new  occurring more often  with less effort  lasting longer  or getting worse
981,get checked now lots of possible reasons but take pain around heart seriously and get it checked asap
982,concern you need to rule out heart attack go to emergency room or call ambulance or contact your physician now
983,cant tell  so needs cant tell  so needs an evaluation a person with chest pain needs a doctors evaluation  often at the er  to rule out a heart attack depending on age and other risk factors  a heart attack can be less likely or more likely since a person cant really tell  she gets evaluated at the er just to be on the safe side lung disorders and rib cage problems are possible  too
984,cubital tunnel is compression of the ulnar nerve often it feels as you hit your funny bone the ulnar nerve at the elbow if affected gives tingling little ring fingers the small intrinsic muscles of the hand and flexor tendons little and ring and the fcu a strong wrist flexor can also be affected back or chest can also be due to more proximal nerve compression neck or thoracic outlet chest pain check on
985,cubital tunnel numbness to the fingers could be from cubital tunnel syndrome  cervical radiculopathy  neuropathy from dm thyroid issues  calcium metabolism issues check with pcp for metabolic workup of electrolytes: potassium  magnesium  calciumas well as thyroid parathyroid  c spine issues
986,limb on leg sounds like it might be phlebitis  thats doctor talk for a small clot in a superficial vein they are a nuscience more than a serious problem but probably should show it to your doctor for confirmation
987,ih  did you drink very hot liquid or eat very hot food to burn your roof of mouth cold water and ice popsicle will help you ina matter of day or 2 you will feel much better 
988,please discuss with your ob reflux is common in pregnancy
989,not likely theres no way to know for certain without an exam and an ecg however at your age  and with symptoms that are not typical  it is unlikely still  if the problem persists id recommend seeing a physician
990,laser resurfacing laser is more effective overall by using different lasers and laser techniques the depth of surface removed can be finely controlled for optimal response and result no method is 100% successful
991,laser is deeper in general  a deep laser peel will be more effective  but the recovery time will be longer than a moderate chemical peel
992,acne scars one important factor is prevent new scarsget your acne under control find a dermatologist to tackle that with you most treatment to improve the appearance of acne scars use special technology to remodel the skin the device i use to treat acne scars is called ematrixsee for info: http:  wwwsmacbocacom ematrixsublativerejuvenationhtml other options include laser  microderm  or subscision
993,chem peels lasers  and dermabrasion all can help
994,laser is better laser resurfacing is better to improve acne scarring i recommend the fraxel laser four treatments are usually required  but the results will be significantly better that with chemical peeling the fraxel works well for acne scarring  as well as fine lines and wrinkles and photoaging fraxel can be used on most skin types  and all over the face and body the fraxel laser is fda approved
995,depends all acne scars are different seek the advice of an experienced acne scar physician to help treat acne scars with the therapy which is best for you
996,both both are great treatments in the right hands only go to a dermatologist with a lot of experience  not just any laser or salon that does these treatments it can be horrific if performed in the wrong hands
997,tough to treat ice pick acne scars are very difficult to treat a fractionated laser may be able to help
998,research i am not sure what center is by you but my recommendation is to research places within driving distance of where you live get referrals from other physicians you respect and trust or patients then  go for a consult and see which laser is best for your needs hope this helps
999,depends on scar lasers and photodynamic therapy pdt and ipl can be used to treat various aspect of the scar including variable pigmentation  atrophy  irregularities  increased redness hyperemia and active disease i would meet with a dermatologist to discuss the best options for your specific concerns
1000,carbon dioxide laser a co2 laser is most effective with regards to lasers to address moderate acne scars the treatment can be done by a plastic surgeon or dermatologist who is experienced in lasers
1001,fractionated laser one of the best treatments for acne scarring is fractionated laser depending on your skin color  texture and extent of scarring there are different laser options out there a nonablative fractionated laser like the fraxel re:store or dual has no real downtime  but requires multiple treatments a fractionated co2 laser is more aggressive with about a week downtime  but may give faster results
1002,acne scars are tough there are a lot of options available to improve acne scarring the proper treatment depends upon the severity of the scarring topical creams and ointments are not usually helpful noninvasive lasers help with very superficial scarring  more invasive lasers are better for moderate scarring  and both dermabrasion and surgical excision are best for more severe scarring
1003,infection check with your private dermatologist this sound like recurrence of small glutral abscesses leaving hard painful scars or in fact  ongoing abscess formation must be visualized for diagnosis
1004,acne scar options you can never remove a scar  once present however  multiple options for improving the appearance of acne scars exist depending on your skin and exact circumstances your facial plastic surgeon or dermatologist may recommend laser treatments including co2  1550 nm erbium  peels  dermabrasion  or well as topical treatments seek a physician with experience
1005,yes you must first visit a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon to see what type of laser is appropriate for your skin type
1006,yes for some scars in our experience it has been useful for either atrophic acne scars and some of the red elevated scars we have used both the pulsed dye laser and the fractional co2 laser on selected patients with good results
1007,laser for acne scars the active acne should be controlled prior to laser treatment for acne scars to minimize risk of infection
1008,yes first we use the laser to shut down the inflamed oil glands and then we use the co2 laser to treat the acne scars you would want the oil to be under control before undergoing the ablative laser so you do not have so much oozing acne can be triggered by sun  stress  hormones  lack of sleep  picking and more control that first and the scarring second
1009,not likely every treatment has some side effects the experience and skill of the surgeon and the cooperation of the patient in following post operative instructions all play a role in mitigating side effects
1010,best or safest the best would be the deep peels and they should only be performed by a trained physician that would be the phenol peel it would help acne scars not wipe them out but will have downtime the safer method would be a series of medium peels they have limited downtime and are abet safer these would be the jesner plus tca 35% or even the less potent vi peel for acne you will need several
1011,no but sometimes using the vaselinetype ointment afterwards during the healing process can cause some temporary acne flareups
1012,ointment cause acne skin treatment with the laser does not by itself cause acne during the recovery period  however  ointment is generally used to assist in the healing process this ointment can occlude the already swollen sebaceous glands and lead to an acne breakout
1013,lasers for scars your question is a little unclear as in rosacea there is not usually acne scars perhaps you meant acne vulgaris rather than acne rosacea anyway  you would be able in most circumstances to be able to receive laser for the redness of rosacea or laser for acne scars
1014,diagnosis im going to ask the dermatologists online to review this question  but i am wondering about something since both amyopathic dermatomyositis and acne rosacea produce a butterfly rash on the face  is it possible that you have only one of the two  and the other might be an overcall forgive me  but this did catch my attention good luck
1015,it depends it depends on the scar if you have diffuse  irregular scars  and erbium or co2 laser would help if you have flexible scars that come to the surface when stretched  then filler materials like hyaluronic acid can help other lasers can help with red scars icepick  deep scars can be removed surgically
1016,go for consultations usually most laser centers do not charge consultation charges see a few when you see them  ask the that you want to meet their old patients see the patients and discuss with them and decide
1017,500 dollars it will cost at least 500 dollars and more likely 1000 to 1500 dollars
1018,derm argon laser not usually utilized for hypertrophic acne scarring successful treatment of acne scarring requires not only an understanding of appropriate treatments for different scar types  but also skilled execution of the procedure by the physician see a cosmetic dermatologist for best evaluation
1019,see specialist and get their opinion on your specific situation
1020,acne scars vs lasers very hard to tell via the internet best to seek in person examinations from a term doing laser therapies
1021,not really if they abad enough to bother you you ptrobably need more effective treatment
1022,yes and no may be helpful for acne  but too aggressive amy actually worsen acnebe very careful i would partner with a dermatologist to coordinate will not effect acne scars
1023,laser generally safe laser skin resurfacing can improve  but generally not eliminate  acne scars shallow scars respond more favorably than deeper  ice pick scars complications with laser resurfacing include pigmentary changes of the skin either darkening or lightening that maybe temporary or permanent scarring  skin infections  lines of demarcation can occur seek a provider with experience in laser resurfacing
1024,great results i would recommend a tuned erbium laser for the best results and minimal recovery these interventions if pormed appropriately should not have long term cons
1025, ive never heard of laser resurfacing on the glans if done it would be so painful it would probably require general anesthesia im sure insurance would not cover it
1026,depends different acne scars require different treatments see cosmetic dermatologist for exam recommendations
1027,not really you can produce improvements in the scars but you cannot laser them off costs will vary and multiple sessions will likely be required with a total cost ranging from 100015  000 usd expect improvements but not complete eradication of scarring
1028,see below there in no one price in the usa for acne treatment using lasers the price is going to be quite a bit higher if the procedure is done in the city like ny or la
1029,timing if these are shortly after acne  i would use sunblock to minimize their becoming worse in some instances long established redness can be treated with lasers discuss with a dermatologist or plastic surgeon
1030,treat not cure wr still dont completely understand the causes of acne but a fairly clear picture of the outcome treatments are targeted to reduce sebaceous oil gland activity and associated or secondary bacterial growth
1031,acne clear skin may be obtained by talking to a dermatogist a combination of antibacterial creams or gels and washes may be prescribed  other times oral antibiotics and accutane may be used  gentle cleaning and no picking is recommended
1032,fractionated laser one of the best treatments for acne scarring is fractionated laser depending on your skin color  texture and extent of scarring there are different laser options out there a nonablative fractionated laser like the fraxel re:store or dual has no real downtime  but requires multiple treatments a fractionated co2 laser is more aggressive with about a week downtime  but may give faster results
1033,acne scars acne scars are very difficult to treat they can be treated with lasers or dermabrasion however this alone will not give the best results you have to get fillers to smoother out the skin as well
1034,equal fractional lasers use a laser beam that is delivered to the skin with a grid pattern this leaves minute patches of untreated skin between laser spots this allows faster healing with less risks no laser is very effective against deep scars and are better for superficial scarring deeper scars may require surgical revision or dermabrasion
1035,no difference both technologies use a microspot co2 laser which treats approximately 30% of the surface skin of the face with one treatment the treatment recommended would depend on your scars and skin type icepick scars respond best to punch excision and later resurfacing deeply irregular textured scars sometimes respond best to dermabrasion find a surgeon skilled in all techniques for best results
1036,chemical peels chemical peel may also remove precancerous skin growths  soften acne facial scars and even control acne in certain cases  health insurance may cover the peel procedure be sure to check your policy and contact your insurance company before the procedure is performed
1037,if if you are having trouble breathing or if you are having difficulty swallowing liquidsother than pain you should go to the emergency room you dont ever want to be in a position that you can not get oxygen if you are having symptoms of possible mononucleosis but you are not in acute distress you should call your doctor back as he will likely need to reexamine you and get updated history for your new signs and symptoms you sound like you feel really yucky hope you feel better soon
1038,cannot diagnose you need to see a doctor  be examined and diagnosed and treated by somebody face to face cannot do this over the internet
1039,viral could also be viral pharyngitis in that case antibiotics also not indicated
1040,virus a negative throat culture means you have a viral illness that will run its course thraot spray or tylenol for comfort is ok  but antibiotics will not help
1041,several possible go see a doctor and have this examined you may have an abscess behind your tonsils  you may have other severe infections in the upper respiratory tract  but cannot diagnose this over the internet
1042,throat thyroid gland  lymph node  tumor  etc please see a head and neck specialist
1043,not necessarily your doctor came to your diagnosis after considering your entire clinical picture  not just presence or absence of white stuff
1044,no you cant tell the difference between a strep throat and a viral sore throat by looking you have to do the test
1045,it it would be reasonable to take a repeat pregnancy test in that situation taking it with your first morning urine can be helpful  as that is when the urine is most concentrated ask your pharmacist for the most accurate test that is also easy to read if your symptoms persist  it would be reasonable to consult your physician
1046,take a preg test could be need to know when your last period was and last unprotected sex take a urine pregnancy test to be sure
1047,trouble trouble breathing can be a scary symptom and an emergency if youfeel it is an emergency then definitely go to the er a swollen tonsila nd sore throat can be as simple as a virus or can be serious a full history would include how long youhave had these symptoms if it is acute and accompanied by fever  then you should see a primary care doctor for a possible strep throat you doctor can determine if this is appropriate if it has been there longer than 23 weeks  is getting worse  you have other lumps int he neck  then you should go to your doctor to rule out other serious conditions
1048,if if you are having trouble breathing then it may be a good idea to go to an er or urgent care clinic to be seen sooner and to get an examination
1049,swollen lymphnode see you doctor if it does not go down after throat infection is treated
1050,otc or mds office both of the above locations do pregnancy tests otc is over the counter that you purchase and do yourself
1051,otc or mds office both of the above locations do pregnancy tests otc is over the counter that you purchase and do yourself
1052,you may have injured your neck which can cause all the pains not sure why you have leg pain could be unrelated trauma and strain can do the same also
1053,probably unrelated the upper respiratory infection is not likely to be related to the right sided pain  but even if it is  you should be able to eat one concern is  however  that this may be strep throat  which can produce abdominal pain  and that should be treated with antibiotics see your doctor
1054,very unlikely depoprovera is a very reliable method depoprovera failures are very rare you could always take a home pregnancy test to reassure your self
1055,need more info interesting symptoms but not enough info to give you a reasonable answer please see your family physician soon
1056,see a doctor you need a full detailed evaluation including history  physical exam and perhaps some testing that will include imaging studies xray  ct  etc 
1057,see below if the nodes are swollen and painful  get seen to rule  out any serious illnesses like lymphadenitis
1058,get evaluated see an ortho did you have mri any arthritis any trauma swellling can be related to the way yore walking may need arthroscopy age a factor get evaluated by ortho
1059,no pain many viruses can cause white spots on the tonsils if no fever or pain  you can let it run its course if anything changes  see your primary care doctor for further evaluation
1060,wrist or tendon i cannot tell specifically from your description but it could be the wrist or the swelling could be in tendon sheaths have it evaluated
1061,many causes there are many different potential causes for sore throats while strep throat and mono are two of the most famous causes  there are many other more common viral and some less common bacterial infections which can cause sore throat if your symptoms do not improve within the next few days or if it becomes increasingly difficult to swallow then you need to see a doctor for followup good luck
1062,sore sore throat is a fairly common symptom associated with many illnesses most of the time it resolves on its own without any other issues occasionally it can be due to something more serious that needs treatment without examining you myself and sending tests  i cannot tell you what you have reasons to seek care again are:  any fever  since it could be strep and you cant tell without an exam testing  were you tested for strep  if it lasts longer than 3 or 4 days  any difficulty opening your mouth  unable to swallow  severe pain  bleeding in the throat  redness or swelling on the outside of the neck  any difficulty breathing or noisy breathing 9 days is a long time to have a sore throat and sometimes as the illness goes along  clues as to what is causing your pain can become more apparent give your doctor another call or consider seeing an ear  nose and throat specialist in the meantime  taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain  drinking plenty of fluids such as hot tea broth or cold liquids and a spoonful of honey can help
1063,prolonged sore throa with a nine day history of a sore throat you could possibly have a retro pharyngeal abscess you should be seen by an ent physician he may want to order xrays of your upper airway
1064,herpangina usually viral tonsillitis herpangina  mono  herpes stomatitis which usually resolves but takes forever bacterial causes are strep throat etc quick visit and testing should pinpoint the culprit  in the meantime lemon  honey gargle works great regards
1065,rapd rapd streptococcal antigen tests rsat have a sensitivity of 7090% and a specificity of 90100% thus a false positive rsat is unlikely the major treatable bacterial pathogen is group a streptococcus which should have responded to augmentin antimicrobial resistance has not been a significant issue in group a streptococcal pharyngitis the conventional duration of oral antibiotic therapy to achieve maximal pharyngeal eradication rates is ten days  although patients usually feel better within the first several days a followup evaluation should include a throat culture  because you may have nongroup a beta hemolytic streptococcus a positive throat culture will yield a sensitivity panel which should help guide therapy it is correct that organisms present in a specimen collected from a patient with a partially treated infection may not grow on routine medium symptomatic relief can be often be achieved with antihistamines and decongestants that are available over the counter i hope you feel better if this approach also fails  i would consider other modalities  but that would involve an office visit
1066,yes you must rule out the possibility of bleeding into the brain there is a well known lucid interval that may last for hours following a head injury it would be wise to go to the emergency room and rule out the possibility of a sub dural bleed
1067,get checked it is best to get checked as soon as possible dont think that you can sleep off a concussion its better to be safe
1068,blisters one consideration is herpangina  like hand foot mouth disease this viral illness can be quite tender  and resolves without treatment a physician would also inquire about sick contacts  fever  fatigue  runny nose or other exposures more severe disease cannot be excluded without further details
1069,infection you still have an infection and it could be viral or bacterial a negative strep is nice but sometimes it cannot be found on the tonsils if it is in the lymph node itself your ear hurts because the pain is referred up the eustachian tube to your ear fro your throat homeopathic pulsatilla may help as may gargling with salt water your doctor may also prescribe antibiotics if it is persistent
1070, strep test your dr should have done a  real  culture rather than depend on the rapid strep test  the rapid strep test has problems 95% sensitive   meaning it will miss 5 out of 100 people tested  it is 98 %specific meaning 2 out of 100 people tested are fals positive  therefore a positive culture done by the microbiology will need to be treated by antibiotics  you can still have ta virus
1071,infection it sounds like you are developing small lymph nodes these often form in response to infection it would be best to see your doctor for an evaluation of your scalp and ear to try and find the source of infection so that it can be treated
1072,best to be seen unable to tell you dx from your symptoms  but it would be best to be seen today and get the answers
1073,concentration concentration in urine causes test to turn positive at earlier time late pregnancy positive at any time
1074,does it matter most tests pick up a bhcg of about 20 i am not sure why this is useful information though a bhcg coubles every 48 hours even in the rare cicumstance where someone checks a test so early it can not detect it say a level of 19 48 hours later your level is high enough for detection home pregnancy tests are very simple and very accurate
1075,pregnancy test pregnancy test done in doctors office is usually very accurate
1076,pretty accurate but not as accurate as a blood one
1077,what us this you have not described any disease or condition what is your concern and what possibly would motivate you to do pregnancy tests you are having regular expected periods
1078,2 weeks if you can stand the wait  you are most likely to have a positve hpt if it should be positive two + weeks postfertilization
1079,pregnant best to get a blood test or repeat the urine pregnancy test in a couple of days
1080,pituitary pituitary makes hcg normally low levels of the hormone may be within the normal pattern please discuss the matter with your doctor if a quantitative assay for the hormone level are warranted
1081,emergency due to the possibility of a tubal pregnancy i would see your doc sooner than later
1082,please see your obgy for a blood preg test   exam and ultrasound to see if u are still preg or had an early spont misc
1083,proteinuria protein in the urine after 20 weeks of pregnancy can mean the onset of preclampsia  its existence earlier can suggest underlying kidney disease diseases such as diabetes  and lupus  can present with protein in the urine at the onset if you still have protein in your urine you should consult your doctor who might refer you to a kidney doctor kidney disease can worsen during pregnancy
1084,repeat it is certainly a low hcg level but still you would need to have it repeated in order to have a final diagnosis with pregnancy the levels should be raising steadily make sure you follow up with your gyn provider in order to get all the tests that you need in order to find out
1085,not pregnant no you are not pregnant i believe you have been told this repeatedly i do not understand what you are misreading or not understanding from both your physician and us here you are not pregnant you do not have an ectopic pregnancy
1086,home pregnancy tests are very accurate they are the same tests used in a doctors office they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period  if you doubt the result you can repeat it in 12 days if you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection
1087,skipped a bc pill if you missed a period  start doing urine home pregnancy tests it is possible that you are pregant but not a sure thing
1088,can do a preg test maybe not pregnant but can do a test a urine preg test done correctly gives a reliable result 3 weeks after sex 3 weeks after when conception might have happened if done sooner  a positive result is likely real  but a negative result may be due to testing too soon and therefore lead to a repeat test if a woman has her normal regular period  then she is not pregnant  and a test is not needed
1089,not very likely pregnancy tests are very accurate if you ovulated later than expected though it may take longer for a test to show up wait a few days and repeat it schedule a visit with an obgyn to have your abnormal vaginal discharge evaluated and tested for infections
1090,probably not  but at the lab i use  we consider everything less than 6 a negative result but every lab has its own cutoff sometimes we will repeat borderline tests in a week just to be sure best wishes
1091,urine pregnancy test a urine pregnancy test is easy to do many women have occasional variation of their mucus discharge  some spotting between periods  a heavier period  a lighter period  or even a missed period having one or two of these symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean there is a medical problem  but a visit to one’s primary care or obgyn doctor is a good idea if symptoms are persistent  recurring  or worrisome
1092,possibly see your doctor for evaluation could be several explanations for this
1093,if you miss your period  go ahead and check however  pms symptoms are not always consistent take care
1094,you can you can see the heartbeat as early as 56 weeks  but not much more you ob may wait until 810 weeks to do an ultrasound  when we can see more of the embryo or make sure its ok
1095,urine misread probably the urine was misread or a strip that was truly unequivacle or read as weak positive  in theses cases a confirmatory blood test was performed appropriately which was negative if your period does not come  you can repeat the blood test in 2 weeks to be safe  and then await for the next period  if that does not come get secondary ammenorhea workup
1096,yes pregnancy is possible repeat pregnancy test in a week take care
1097,natural variation there are biological variations in hormone levels as well as other characteristics  e g height  among individuals the normal levels of all hormones have a wide range and this range is even more marked with hcg see this site for more info though it does not address your question directly http:  americanpregnancyorg duringpregnancy hcglevelshtml

1104,10 days beta hcg in serum will be gone at 10 days from the shot
1105,yes assuming your cycles are regular predictable  if your period started 11 10  then you arent pregnant  its too early to do pregnancy test early as 1014 days after conception  certainly by 710 days after a missed period are time frames when you can check if yore pregnant by a home pregnancy test if you have 28 day cycles  try timing sex on 11 22  11 24  11 26 days 12  14  16 of cycle
1106,possible an hcg of 60 would be seen in early pregnancy  like in the first week or two the level doubles every 72 hours and this is the best marker to follow if you are having significant pain  get checked always possibility of tubal pregnancy which is dangerous otherwise notify your provider and the best course of action would be to check you hcg in 3 days
1107,several things you have symptoms which could be serious and should see your physician he she will listen to you  do a physical examinarion  run some tests  and let you know whats going on

1112,yes these symptoms may point to an autoimmunedisorder and i suggest consultation with drcould also be flu  but your mention of again and the low gfr is bothersome
1113,yes gargling with salt water is fine most cough drops are fine as is tylenol in appropriate doses if you are running a fever or the sore throat doesnt improve pretty rapidly  you need to see your doctor while most sore throats are viral and not helped by antibiotics  it is possible that you may need medication hope this helps and you feel better fast
1114,symptoms of viral infection its good to do thraot culture to exclude strep infection
1115,flu vs cold flu symptoms can include fever  chills  sore throat  cough  headaches  nasal congestion marked aching of muscles and joints  significant fatigue when present  nausea  vomiting and loose stools are more often seen in children in general  the flu will cause you to feel more ill than a cold will colds tend to lead to more nasal congestion than the flu
1116,the flu adds deep chills and an awful sensation  recc go be checked is feeling very ill
1117,no never give a prescription med not prescribed to a person without permission of that persons doctor also  adult peptobismol should not be given to children 16 years and younger read labels try sips 12 tsps of flat 7up sprite every 10 minutes for a couple of hours  then gradually increase amount slowly as long as its not being vomited see md if no better in 1224 hours on clear liquids
1118,yes amoxicillin is a safe antibiotic to use during pregnancy
1119,it can bec ur md many different diseases can cause abdominal pain  some mild  others serious it is impossible to make even an educated guess without betterunderstanding the type  duration  and frequency of your pain what brings it on  what relieves it your age  sex  past history physical examination findings results of supportive tests which may include blood tests +  xrays we can only do this inperson
1120,could be symptoms of appendicitis or ovarian cyst  or tumor are not always as expected in the text books  so proper evaluation by doctors with experience is priceless see your obgyn if you are female or a general surgeon kidney stones can also cause similar presentation  so you do need a proper evaluation
1121,yes the combination of abdominal pain  vomiting  chills and diarrhea is serious do not delay and see a doctor quickly the differential diagnosis here is broad you need a thorough doctor to help you
1122,maybe  get tested cant tell here see a doc  get examined  and perhaps get a strep test could be strep  viral  mono  other
1123,several possibles she may have one of the many stomach viruses that are circulating around right now  or something that might need antibiotics like strep throat it is very common at that age for kids to complain of headache and stomach ache long before they complain their throat hurts if she is feeling that ill by the morning  have her see the doctor tomorrow to be assessed and properly diagnosed and treated
1124,gastrointestinal could be a virus  flu  food poisoning  etc even a low grade fever is worthy of attention  drink lots of water dehydration is a risk if its still there  consider having an exam and describe your symptoms when you call be exact w  the temperature and be prepared to answer questions about contacts that might have exposed you to ebola best
1125,gi infection there are some parasitic infections of your stomach that may cause persistence of symptoms like nausea and diarrhea beyond a week  by which time viral infections generally are subsiding pl see your doctor or go to an urgent care for a quick evaluation  needed testing and treatment as needed
1126,call them back your doctor just saw and examined you  let him her know yore worse call the doctor back before they go home for the day
1127,enterovirus it can take 710 days for enterovirus to run its course
1128,a few days enterovirus infections can last anywhere from a few days to a week be sure to drink plenty of fluids  and have everyone wash their hands frequently and thoroughly to prevent the virus from spreading
1129,bronchitis this is virus caused in >95% of cases if you are wheezing and having any respiratory insufficiency difficulty breathing you should see a pulmonologist asap good luck and get better
1130,definitely bronchitis symptoms are usually cough and wheezing in a nonsmoker it is almost always viral and antibiotics are not useful if your wheezing and cough are bad and you are low on oxygen then the doctor may prescribe a steroid and inhaler to help you breathe better it is also possible that you have pneumonia see a doctor tomorrow for exam
1131,you you will be able to give motrin again at midnight motrin can be given every 6 hours and tylenol can be given every four hours fevers for the most part arent dangerous and are just the bodys natural reaction to fighting off an infection most of these infections are viral and may be accompanied by runny nose  sore throat  congestion  mild rash  or nothing at all since fevers arent dangerous  we usually treat the fever with acetaminophen or ibuprofen just to make the child more comfortable as their body fights the illness red flags that we look for with fever to indicate something more serious is going on are: fevers that last 5 days or more fevers persistently above 104f orally a child that acts very sick  very irritable or difficult to wake difficulty breathing vomiting  diarrhea  refusal to drink  or dehydration a purple rash  esp on the legs stiff neck any complaints of pain such as the ear  throat  stomach or a joint as always  use your judgement if you think that your child is ill  err on the side of caution and call your childs doctor

1133,yes it is yes it is possible the symptoms of stomach flu are so variable so you can have stomach flu without vomiting and diarrhea
1134,sore throat no  see a doctor early for a throat culture to rule out a strep throat
1135,viral infection many cold viruses also cause stomach and intestinal infection that can cause abdominal pain  vomiting and diarrhea this condition is usually self limiting and resolves within 4872 hours
1136,yes the vomiting  diarrhea and especially the sore throat put him at risk of dehydration given the fact that he is losing fluids and might not want to eat drink as usual you need to make sure his illness is no something that need to be acted immediately on good luck
1137,depends on cause there are many things that can give a child cramps  ranging from constipation  lactose intolerance  and gas to recurrent abdominal pain of childhood please have your child seen by his her doctor to determine the cause once you have a diagnosis  then appropriate treatment can be determined
1138,gallbladder if you have not had your gallbladder removed you could have a gallbladder infection with nausea  vomiting  headache  dizziness i think you should go to the er
1139,ibd you may need colonoscopy to confirm diagnosis may need short term steroids and mesalamine for long time good luck with gi doctor
1140,see md you have been having a plethora of symptoms that need a md to evaluate in a examination fashion
1141,strep strep throat bacterial infection often is not associated with cough  however fever is commonly present regardless  if your sore throat is getting worse and you are having difficulty eating swallowing then you should be seen by a medical professional most doctos offices and urgent cares have a test called a rapid strep test they will be able to tell you in minutes if you have strep throat if so  antibiotics will be started and you will feel better within 24 days on the other hand you may be dealing with a viral thoat infection pharyngitis antibiotics will not be helpful in this situation these tend to last 714 days regardless of the cause pain medications can be used to help alleviate the pain
1142,possible strep sore throat may be the first sign of strep throat  but also could be the first symptom of a viral infection a swab for screening and  or culture may be helpful
1143,too soon you should still get it checked out by your family doctor
1144,yes while not the typical area where pimples happen  they can occur in the genital region due to an over activity of the sebaceous glands or ingrown hair any of the otc spot treatments for acne would take it away pretty quickly dont pop it hope that helps
1145,maybe have your doctor look at it to determine if its an std  another problem  or a normal penile pearl
1146,possibly any time there is question of whether a skin lesion on the penis is an std  it must be seen and evaluated not all skin lesions are stds but visual inspection is very important in addition to clinical history also  some skin lesions may resolve spontaneously and are an std  making one believe that everything is okayif there is a chance it may a sexually contracted lesion  it needs to be checked
1147,hard to guess for your peace of mind  please see a doctorif you dont have one   check with your local health dept
1148,penis the only way to know the significance of these lesions is to show them to a physician
1149,here are some… what you described could be in bone inborn  but you just incidentally discovered them clinically  it would be most logical to leave them alone as long as not bothering you and not increasing their size  number if so  they are not std of course  you may seek professional evaluation  counseling as needed best wish…
1150,probably not none of the stds does that its probably a skin issue eczema is common
1151,std maybe does your partner have any lesion   discharge this is not something you want to ignore you should see your md asap for a proper exam of your lesion the correct diagnosis maybe something simple as allergic contact dermatitis not related to sexual activity  or an infection by an organism known for impersonating other illnessessyphilis this would require antibiotics see you md to be safe
1152,possibly folliculit likely a blocked sweat gland causing a mild folliculitis also known as an inflammation of the base of a hair follicle if if persists or doesnt improve you should be seen
1153,this this is very difficult to answer without a clinical examination could be many diagnoses including psoriasis  eczema  lichen planus all can be seen on the penis  or possibly molluscum contagiosum  warts  or another std i would recommend you see a dermatologist but also there are a few pictures of these conditions at the link below i hope that helps a little
1154,asked and answered it is not an std none would show up this quickly and he wore a condom your question has been accurately answered
1155,sti you can get sexually transmitted infections from oral sex  so get checked out and always use condoms
1156,hiv very rare to see hiv infection from oral sex  however  certainly other stds can be transmitted orally hiv usually in semen  blood  anal secretions get checked for all
1157,medical evaluation see a doctor to evaluate and treat you
1158,itching is not std itching is usually dry skin or a fungal infection by itself it is not diagnostic of any std
1159,when in doubt check it out evaluation of an unusual rash at the penis should prompt further evaluation by a trained physician all the best
1160,colud be either  if you mean a viral condyloma being an std both condyloma  hemorrhoid can be a raised lump see a doctor for an exam
1161,pearly penile papule in all likelihood these are pearly penile papules and are not considered abnormal there is no treatment necessary if this is determined to be the case you may want to show your physician to be certain
1162,pearly penile papule in all likelihood these are pearly penile papules and are not considered abnormal there is no treatment necessary if this is determined to be the case you may want to show your physician to be certain
1163,warm compress warm moist compresses should help this resolve faster and provide some pain relief resist the urge to squeeze or poke it  as this could cause infection
1164,rash both be checked by your physician and have cultures if necessary your doctor may be able to diagnose your problem from an exam your symptoms sound suspicious for a yeast infection all the best sorting this out
1165,many possibilities most genital skin rashes are not stds  and your description doesnt sound like an std some likely to itch are eczema  scabies  contact dermatitis or other allergy  psoriasis especially if you have psoriasis elsewhere it could be a fungal or bacterial infection  especially if you are uncircumcised whatever the cause  it isnt likely to be serious see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment
1166,need an exam its not clear if you are having pain on urination or pain in general in the penis either way std is possible  including herpes many women with hsv are unaware that they have it and have not had significant symptoms you need to see a physician to diagnose your condition and treat it
1167,may be due to friction  inflammation or contact with dormant bacteria in any case you must be examined and cannot be diagnosed online give it a break sexually for 10 days sure you can  get checked and be safe
1168,possible to have std needs to rule out std   you both should see infectious disease physician
1169,it it is very difficult to say without actually seeing the lesion however  you should definitely be evaluated by a doctor or other health care provider it could simply be a small abscess  which is bacterial and not an std however things like herpes  syphilis  etc need to be ruled out if you are uninsured there are many free clinics that provide std testing they will be able to tell you if you are dealing with an std or something as simple as a pimple my last bit of advice  please remember to always wear condoms good luck
1170,lesion on penis you should have this checked out by a family physician
1171,here are some  apparently  this small white pimple is incidentally selffound and most likely represents a hyperactive sebaceous gland of hair follicle or a sebaceous cyst  but its harmless and requires no rx as long as not hurting you and staying in small size until getting infected occasionally without looking at it  its still hard to offer accurate dx so seek proevaluation  counseling if still in doubt
1172,hard to tell most skin issues really need to be seen to be diagnosed well there are a lot of other questions to be asked as well there are several things this could be  including sebaceous gland  dermatofibroma  lichen planus  wart  sexually transmitted disease  etc dont be too worried about it  but have someone look at it
1173,could be either hard to tell with out seeing it may need to be drained especially for a diagnosis so you should get it checked out  
1174,std unlikely the primary worry is that this represents herpes in most cases  though  a herpes blister is very painful so this would argue against herpes otherwise it could just represent a sebaceous inclusion cyst this should be evaluated and a culture for herpes can be obtained
1175,depends there are many nonstd reasons you could have a lesion on your penis from excema  to psoriasis  to a pimple  to a bug bite  etc if it is bothersome or persists  see your provider
1176,ingrown hairs this may possibly be just some ingrown hairs with associated itchiness as the shaved area is growing back in the cold you caught from your girlfriend  quite probably
1177,possibly several stds can cause burning with urination or ejaculation be seen for an exam and diagnosis
1178,odd are it is likely related to a clog gland or hair follicle or cyst but without examining the lesion its difficult to say reassuringly most stds dont cause painless bumps though syphilis can cause a painless ulcer if you are that worried seek an evaluation with your doctor but if the lesion is external consider placing warm packs to the area in the meanwhile to see if the lesion will drain
1179,cyst this could be bartholin cyst  and requires evaluation by gynecologist for culture and treatment may try sitz baths twicethree times a day for 3 days to promote healing and provide comfort but definitely see gyn if no improvement
1180,probably not if you are having a burning sensation  you need to get checked again a few days after sex is not sufficient you may have a uti  but you should have symptoms of going a lot or burning when you urinate if not  you should get checked again to make sure you dont have early std dont worry and always use protection
1181,get vaccinated even with your family history  yore probably not at increased risk of hpvrelated cancers but all people should get the vaccine that prevents 4 of the genital hpv types  especially at your age  regardless of apparent risk the frequency of genital hpv and hpvrelated cancers is the same in people with very few and very many sex partners why take any risk when its so easily prevented
1182,hpv vaccine can help decrease cervical cancer as it helps keep the cause of the cancer away  talk to your fp or gyn to see if this for you
1183,combination benadryl  pepcid for swelling  skin symptoms cold pack for swelling topical cortisone cream for local reaction
1184,yes benadryl may help
1185,er or primary md initially cold will help and antiinflammatories such as anvil or motrin if not contraindicated reaction can be treated with oral steroids if necessary
1186,your question does not say what started this so your question is not a complete question itchiness in your mouth can be due to an allergy to a food  medicine  or dental care product like toothpaste or mouthwash
1187,many possible causes allergy reaction to a food or dental product need more info and an examination by a doctor to correctly diagnose
1188,po#3 swelling yes but best to see your lipo surgeon to inform you of the healing phases you will be going through postop lipo swelling appears worse early that takes unto 3 months to resolve but we i do not know your history or type of liposuction therefore see your chosen surgeon
1189,allergy to bee sting you need to use epipen  you must carry them with you all the time speak with your doctor good luck
1190,ice  elevate not consistent with allergic reaction you are not likely allergic to this type of insect  whatever it was and not a situation where you would want to use an epipen if you have an insect allergy  it is important to know signs of a systemic allergic reaction wholebody hives  face lip tongue swelling  wheezing short of breath  nausea  urge to defecate  dizziness etc see allergist
1191,stop stop using the new detergent and switch to one without harsh chemicals or fragrances something like ivory or similar store brandssee your family doc for a check of the symptoms to make sure that is what it actually is
1192,get xray might have fracture go to doctor or urgent care or hospital
1193,see your doctor if redness  swelling  or pain is spreading  you should see your doctor you may have an abscess a collection of pus under the skin which may require antibiotic treatment
1194,bee sting immediately ice packs will help decrease the swelling also antihistamines and or advil will help
1195,bee stings clean area w soap  warm water apply ice in 10 min increments 10 on 10 off can try tylenol  aspirin or motrin for pain or benadryl for swelling make paste of 2 parts baking soda  1 part water  apply need tetanus shot every 10 years throat  airway  mouth swelling or difficulty breathing call 911
1196,compresses i would try very warm moist compresses as warm as you can tolerate for 15 minutes every few hours that can help draw out the infection and swelling do not squeeze it or try to drain it yourself if yove had it more than a few days or its causing discomfort or vision problems  see your doctor who may prescribe antibiotic eye drops or ointment ask a pharmacist for otc treatments
1197,theres no otc antibiotic eye drops that u can use however u can apply warm packs and take motrin nsaids which can relieve it follow up with ur pcp take care http:  wwwmwebmdcom eyehealth understandingstyebasics
1198,see dermatologist you need to give more details on the distribution of the rash such as whether it crosses the bridge of your nose i suspect what you may have is rosacea which is aggravated by any increase in core body temperature but on skin rash  one really needs to look at the lesions themselves to venture a guess
1199,see dermatologist you need to give more details on the distribution of the rash such as whether it crosses the bridge of your nose i suspect what you may have is rosacea which is aggravated by any increase in core body temperature but on skin rash  one really needs to look at the lesions themselves to venture a guess
1200,dont shave or dont shave as close you will need to use other methods
1201,maybe some peoples skin are clearly more sensitive than others skin prep may be key for you  right after or during a shower may help since the heat from the steam will make shaving smoother make sure you are using a new blade do you get these bumps anywhere else that you shave underarms if so  check with a dermatologist
1202,painful or not is it painful have you ever had them before are there any other bumps elsewhere on your body or in your mouth if its painful  it could be a canker sore if not  it could be an inflamed taste bud or a benign fibroma  possibly from past trauma to the tongue i would recommend that you go to your doctor and have it looked at
1203,two weeks sounds like you have subconjunctival hemorrhage which is due to bleeding trapped between the white or sclera and clear membrane or conjunctiva of the eye it usually takes two weeks to clear if it does not clear see a board certified ophthalmologist near you or on health tap healthtapcom rebeccamammo ckkmcr
1204,yes both steroids and esepcially benadryl have the sdie effect of making people tired or sleepy
1205,yes steroids can make you feel funny and benadryl is well known for producing drowsiness  it is the prime ingredient in many over the counter sleep aids
1206,pearly penis papules ring of small skin colored bumps around head of penis just beyond the circumferential groove are normal and nothing to be concerned about sometimes called tysons glands  but in fact are not glands tend to be more promininent in the uncircumcised penis
1207,folliculitis this may be due to folliculitis or other causes the best solution is to see a dermatologist for a consultation  diagnosis  and treatment recommendations  hygiene and exfoliation will help but medications may be required  laser hair removal can also help
1208,keep doing what you are doing it is not uncommon for a forceful contusion to make such a dent as you describe icing and elevation are the best things to do  for up to 48 or 72 hours then resume normal activities avoiding anything that seems to increase the swelling or pain ie running  overexertion the dent may remain a surprisingly long timeeven months to years: sorry take care of yourself
1209,treat a bee sting if you arent allergic remove the stinger with a metal object knife scraping at an angle the venom sac keeps pumping until removed apply ice to reduce pain swelling as a beekeeper ive found rubbing the area with a cut onion for several minutes helps avoid scratching and apply calamine lotion as needed take heart in that your next sting will be less painful
1210,see podiatrist soon you should see a podiatrist soon or go to emergency room for treatment you can try taking benadryl which is over the counter
1211,infection vs ingrown some people get folliculitis an infection along the hair follicle perhaps the barbers equipment is not clean  topical antibiotic ointment can help or in bad cases  oral antibiotics from your doctor sometimes people can get a fungal infection tinea capitis  google it another possibility in ingrown hair if the haircut was very short in that case you need to keep the hair longer
1212,time to see a doctor this could be many things and should be checked since it is getting worse
1213,swelling when legs are swollen there are a few possibilities most often it is edema excess salt water and is evidence of one of the following: heart condition  kidney condition  liver condition  medication side effect  massive sodium intake lower leg swelling can also occur with a conditions like lymphedema  hypothyroidism  obesity  blood clot  and many more unexplained or new leg swelling needs eval
1214,knee pain get prescription antiinflammatories such as meloxicam
1215,allergic reactionthe most common is the kind of rash that comes from burning poison ivy you should also check out your eye makeup assuming you are using it and purchase a hypoallergenic brand hope this helps dr z
1216,allergic rxn this might be an allergic rxn to some thing you consumed or you came in contact with in your environment  you have to trace your steps back and see what you had to eat before this developed  it could be meds or a combination of things  it could be a plant material you were exposed to in the yard or a nursery  use benadryl at night and allegra during the day  avoid scratching see pcp 
1217,sounds like an oral antibiotic might be in order the hanging nail needs to be addressed as well
1218,yes  at first this may be a paronychium inflammation around the area where the nail meets the fingers tissues you can try frequent every several hours prolonged warm soaks which can bring this to a head and allow drainage if  however  the redness extends beyond this area  the finger becomes swollen or in any way worse  you should be seen immediately  preferably by a hand surgeon
1219,reocur pimple best to see a derm or plastic to evaluate and possible excise the recurrent lesion
1220,one fast remedy how about applying a paste made up of a 1 to 1 mix of water and baking soda it is a very soothing
1221,rashy hands and feet your daughter probably has a viral illness which frequently results in rashes like these you may have heard of hand foot and mouth disease  where u get ulcers in mouth as well  not all kids these rashes in all parts of body though imp thing to remember is that such illnesses are minor and resolve in a week or so if rash worsens  fever persists or child start acting sick  pl see her pediatrician
1222,exercise with the more levels involved  the less likely surgery will help so exercise  weight control  smoking cessation if applicable can help avoid prolonged positions like standing or sitting that will aggravate the symptoms use of tylenol or antiinflammatory medication can benifit as long as there is no medical reason not to use them pain management may help facet blocks  etc
1223,no simple treatment yours is a complex problem with many levels being affected therefore  a global way to help is weight loss and no smoking there are facet injections which can help some glucosamine chondroitin sulfate may help also there are so many levels involved  it will be best to remain active with a flexibility exercise also such as yoga your local specialist may have some other recommendations
1224,get checked out you are pretty young for heart problems  but pain in the chest with exercise shouldnt be taken lightly you need to get it checked out it is most likely nothing significant  but you must rule out heart problems before you brush it off
1225,yes it may help
1226,knee pain i would still get an xray due to where the pain is rest and ice as well
1227,depends a cyst on the ovary usually doesnt cause swollen lymph glands cysts on the ovary can be normal  functional  or abnormal you should discuss the findings with your gyn
1228,see below if you have done pt  are you doing the exercises that have been prescribed for you to do at home i find that sometimes people forget to do these or think that these are not necessary people do best when they follow the home exercise program at 30 years of age  disc herniations can heal on there own but can take a while  sometimes over a year surgery can fix but will involve a fusion
1229,depends on symptoms the discs in the lower back lumbar spine frequently bulge this can cause some back pain but usually doesnt affect the nerves in a 19 yo if there is a focal disc herniation this can cause problems with the nerves facet arthropathy means there is some inflammation and or degeneration of the joint in the back of the vertebra fluid around the joint suggests this may be a source of pain
1230,need to see images need to see images in order to assess disc herniations would need to see if there is mass effect on traversing or exiting nerve roots facet hypertrophy is an ongoing degenerative process  however with changes of synoivitis  fluid in the facet joints can be symptomatic as well
1231,see below oral antiinflammatory agents are still the beat pain reliever for osteoarthritis  with moderation on activity streching exercises can help  physical therapy is a good adjuct to meds theu can do us treatment  sometimes tens   intraarticular injection can be done by your dr if conservative management is not enough good luck
1232,muscle discomfort in this area of the leg is usually due to muscle strain rest the leg for a week or so to see if the discomfort improves see your physician if discomfort persists
1233,depends on the injur it depends on the severity of the injury i generally recommend you avoid exercises that increase loading to your spine or impact activities thus  biking or elliptical machines or swimming are better than running also  no heavy weight lifting that loads your back such as squats
1234,a lot lifestyle changes are important like not smoking  weight control and regular exercise you can use medication if no contraindications like ibuprophen or naproxen  try a back support  guided exercise  activity modification if no better  then see your doctor for further evaluation and treatment exercise can include walking  elliptical and stairmaster machines to start and then increase it
1235,dont panic 1 the scan is not the pt you are 2 operative word here is mild those findings may cause no symptoms at all 3 in medicine and especially in this sort of situation  1 picture = 1000 words your doc ordered the scan for a reason look at the images with your doc and have them interpret them for you  or find you someone who can you have a right to an explanation in terms you understand
1236,diagnosis the cornerstone of treatment is an accurate diagnosis neither you nor i have any clue whats causing your pain so you need to be evaluated

1351,neuro exam needed the way you classify your symptoms is worrisome you need a full exam with focused neuro exam full lab work including evaluation for lyme disease it d deficiency b12 folic acid thyroid studies then you may need a ct scan vs mri to evaluate for an intrinsic neurologic disease like ms
1352,safe this is well within the safe dose of radiation exposure it is important to remember that time does not reduce the risks of exposure to more radiation in otherwords  radiation exposure doesnt wear off  and is cumulative over your lifetime best way to think about it is if the ct scan is really necessary  do it if if not really necessary  hold off discuss this with your doctor to find out

1373,very low: with negative brain mri  you should feel relaxed to have ruled out serious conditions like ms or any brain pathology most likely cause of your upper body tingling would likely be nerve compression in upper spine  which would require physical therapy to confirm diagnosis  have your doctor order a spinal mri feel better

1393,dry cough given that you have provided us with no information about yourself  not even your age  let alone any medical history or medications  you may have environmental allergies  gastric reflux or pharyngobronchial infection you may try otc antihistamine and ppi to see if you have relief as well as keep well hydrated if no improvement after a few days  see your doctor
1394,viraluri viral upper respiratory infx
1395,dont know cant make that determination without an assessment this may or may not be related to bacterial infection
1396,upper respiratory although you do not have a fever  you do have significant symptoms could be a simple common cold  but it seems your throat soreness is a primary complaint if this has been ongoing for 5 days you should get checked
1397,sore throat it is pharyngitis  sore throat try gargles and steam inhalation also try ibuprofen needs to get evaluated fir strep
1398,viral you are probably developing a viral infection  drink plenty fluids
1399,viral uri without seeing and examining you it is impossible to say what this is  but based upon the description you provided it is not unlikely that this is a viral illness you cannot exclude bacterial almost entirely grp a strep pharyngitis or allergies without a full assessment hope you are better soon
1400,asthma the symptoms you experience during or after exercise is suspicious of exerciseinduced asthma which can easily be prevented treated with an albuterol inhaler prescribed by a doctor please have yourself evaluated
1401,could be swollen trochanteric bursa  if red or warm seek medical attention
1402,non specific not sure what the question really is  but if you are talking about upper respiratory tract or head cold symptoms due to infection versus if they are do to allergies  allergic symptoms tend to occur with exposure to kn own or suspected triggers  would not have fever  or sore throat  infections would be more likely to have fever  sore throat  no clear allergic exposure etc
1403,can be either additional information needed
1404,see your doctor if your symptoms have been going on for this long  its time to see your doctor he she will examine you and probably run some tests to try to get an idea of whats going on
1405,probably a viral uri sounds like a viral upper respiratory infection but you need to have someone look at your throat since this could be tonsillitis strep
1406,consult a doc please see a doc asap you may need treatment
1407,maybe viral infectio for significantly sore throat w swollen tonsils   lymph nodes – see physician  get a strep throat test  culture antibiotics are imperative for strep throat try saltwater gargles mix tsp of salt in 8 oz of warm water – gargle w this several times day you can gargle w aloe vera juice a couple of times per day a mix of chamomile tea w honey  a small amt of lemon juice helps take care
1408,sick with cough you have an acute illness that may be influenza or other infection you should call your ob to report this and not take any medication without your obs consent meanwhile stay hydrated  sip hot water with honey and some lemon  stay in bed  keep warm
1409,see doctor it is time for you to consult a doctor
1410,many possibilities including asthma but also gerd gastroesophageal relux disease or post nasal drip as these other forms of cough can be notoriously worse at night related to how we are more predisposed to severe reflux which csn even present only with a cough or post nasal drip based on how our anatomy changes with our body position sounds like you should review this with your doc
1411,probable it is likely that you have asthma but you really need to see a doctor to confirm the diagnosis and be treated accordingly
1412,see doctor it is time for you to consult a doctor
1413,yes yes  you can still have an acl reconstruction acl tears do not heal on their own  having it replaced can help you maintain a healthy  active lifestyle in the years to come the acl is a major knee stabalizer  and can provide security to your knee that may prevent further damage to nearby tendons  ligaments  muscles  articular cartilage  meniscus   bones when compared to a loose knee
1414,depends on ligament the knee has 4 main ligaments the mcl  and lcl usually heal on their own the acl and pcl do not they usually need surgery pcl tears that isolated do not usually need surgery depending on symptoms acl tears usually need surgery  unless the patient is a sedentary  older individual  or if the patient is a coper
1415,cannot be done ligament is a tough structure that is beneath the skin and currently we dont have the ability to repair a torn ligament without surgery we can do minmially invasive laparoscopic surgery  but still considered surgery because it requires cutting piercing holes to insert the scopessee picture here but you may not need surgery at all if ligament is not essential consult doc good luck
1416,it should improve certain ligaments need to be repaired  your dr makes the call based on the exam and history the knee uses the acl as its primary stabilizer with remaining muscles  ligaments and menisci helping if the acl is not repaired in active people it leads to early onset arthritis be prepared to rehab your knee for several months
1417,no  but often the lateral fibular collateral ligament is uncommonly injured  but if it is injured in the setting of other ligament injuries acl  pcl  it needs to be reconstructed to help prevent the other ligament surgeries from stretching out over time if it is injured in isolation  it can be treated in a hinged knee brace x 6 wks and may heal on its own stress xrays can be used to measure if it heals
1418,no menus cal transplants have not worked well so far the mist important treatment is quadriceps muscle strengthening  weight control  avoiding further injury  and joint conservation techniques
1419,knee pain get prescription antiinflammatories such as meloxicam
1420,acl when you have full painless range of motion  stable exam  adequate rehab  and your operative surgeon says ok 
1421,you definitively need to see an orthopedist and have that knee evaluated
1422,popping simple advice popping with no pain  no treatment needed popping with pain  needs further evaluation and treatment
1423,popping knee consider meniscal tear  synovitis  chondrolysis  ligament tears  loose bodies  tight capsule
1424,acl tear the acl is the main ligament that keeps your shin bone from sliding out from under your thigh bone there are people who can function without one but not usually playing a sport like soccer the greatest risk is that you will go on to tear your meniscus and other cartilage and cause greater damage to your knee i do not advise my patients to play soccer without a reconstruction
1425,yes but be careful the acl is not needed for inline activities it is needed for twisting turning changing directions the symptoms of recurring instability  like you dont trust the knee or it gives out  is the indication for surgery if the knee continues to give out over time  other structures will be damaged  like the meniscus  and the risk of arthritis increases i would not suggest returning to soccer
1426,no knee problems can lead to hip problems but there is no direct relationship between a knee scope and hip grinding
1427,not really the two are not connected in that way
1428,good candidate depends on the severity of the tear  but w  the failed conservative treatment that you describe pt  injections i would think that you are a good candidate for surgery while many options such as pt  injections may help relieve your symptoms  you are likely to have lifelong complications w  a torn meniscus such as arthritis you should see an orthopedist to help evaluate drmarkgallandcom
1429,u need a diagnosis by xray or mri only then will u know how to make it bettergo c an orthopedist
1430,needs workup see an orthopedist asap you may need a cast to immobilize your extremity
1431,neuralgia tingling and burning symptoms are typically nerve based in nature this may be an isolated neuralgia that self resolves if it persists it may be a form of trigeminal fifth nerve neuralgia  a pain condition that can be treated with nerve pain medications a mri of the brain may be recommended if symptoms are persistent
1432,likely surgery these are generally unstable and requires plates and screws you may need a second surgery if your hardware is irritating you
1433,have to see doctor you may have sustained internal injury to knee joint  ligaments   meniscus etc    you have to see orthopedic surgeon for tests and treatment   delay may cause severe damage
1434,find a pain medicine physician who will examine you  and will make all the necessary treatment recommendations
1435,recurrent knee pain this is not a question it is a statement i assume the question is why does it hurt again much more information needed to answer this new injury history of other injury at time of acl tear where does it hurt what causes it to hurt what makes it better any swelling etc
1436,most likely you should be able to consider this activity between 6 months to 1 year after surgery the graft should be adequately incorporated by 6 months  but you must work with therapy to regain leg strength strength is the most protective mechanism against reinjury if you do not feel adequately strong  then continue working in the gym before returning to your sport
1437,yes you can it is possible to have a repair of the repairs acl as for arthritis that is another matter perhaps a second opinion will help there are options that an orthopedic surgeon can give talk to your doctor im sure theres options
1438,tenderness the problem could be from bone  muscle or nerve in that area if there was numbness and  or tingling  a pinched nerve occurring at the entrance of your leg groin region would be suspected see an orthopedic surgeon for evaluation if this symptom persists and appropriate tests or xrays will be ordered a referral to a neurologist can be made if deemed advisable
1439,acl less likely with a low energy extended straight knee injury  it is more likely you sustained a mild knee strain  meniscal tear  and or a ligament sprain mcl common  especially if tender over mcl without a significant acute effusion  an acute acl injury is less likely a simple instability exam by your pcp or orthopaedic surgeon will confirm the diagnosis see md if pain > 10 days
1440,possible landing from a height puts excess stress through the knee it could be as straight forward as a knee sprain or contusion but could also include ligament  meniscus or even fracture
1441,not always pain from meniscal tears often settle down with therapy surgery only needed for continues pain or locking of the knee
1442,usually if it is painful yes if it blocks your motion yes if you cant bend or straighten all the way yes if you are limiting your activity due to the pain or fear of pain  yes if your knee is swelling a lot  yes if it doesnt hurt or limit your activity then no
1443,probably not you need to have the lump evaluated it may be a simple cyst but any lump should be evaluated by a doctor
1444,possible injury any knee instability after injury should be evaluated you should be evaluated by your orthopedic surgeon
1445,possibly if  by a fever blister you mean a cold sore caused by hsv herpes simplex virus  then yes  this indicates that hsv is latent in the system and could potentially reactivate at times of stress or low immunity to cause a cold sore on the lip or mouth  or to cause herpetic eye disease  which commonly manifests on the surface of the eye but could affect the inside of the eye
1446,probably not generally  clots occur because you have 1 a blood condition that promotes clotting or 2 yove been traveling or had a medical problem and were immobile for a long time if your leg isnt swollen or red  its probably not a clot leg pain can be due to many things clots dont make any noise but if yore concerned see your doctor  who might order an ultrasound if indicated by your exam
1447,tough to say i have done thousands of acls and a little pain is not scary  however if it persists  there is locking or instability  it should be checked by your suegeon
1448,knee injury perhaps you sustained an injury to your muscle or bled into the muscle or even sustained a fracture lots of possible causes of painful swelling above the knee best to go see your family doctor for an evaluation  diagnosis  treatment
1449,possible could be true true unrelated or could be related   an orthopedist can help figure this out
1450,varies there are a variety of reasons a person with a prior knee injury might have difficulty standing on their toes on that side one is if the knee has a small flexion contracture  another is if you have some weakness  atrophy in your calf muscle if it is causing you a functional problem  consider being seen and a course of therapy may be beneficial
1451,anything possible however  nothing can be predicted no matter how many symptoms you develop until you see if you miss your next periodif you do then  you get your pregnancy test and find outgood luck
1452,possible not 100% people do get pregnant while on the pill  wait a while longer than get a pregnancy test  if this is negative do not reliey on one test repeat it a couple times a few days apart if negative c ur pcp or gyn 4 a blood test
1453,birth control if you are using your birth control properly then you are protected against getting pregnant
1454,not pregnant please resubmit your question to include where you learned that bleeding in any way could represent pregnancy birth control works taking it daily means you are taking it as prescribed you bled you are not pregnant viable pregnancy stops vaginal bleeding
1455,no if u started u period   u r not pregnant
1456,missed pills if you missed taking your pills in a regular fashion run a pregnancy test otherwise  you probably are not pregnant and your period is just delayed
1457,could be pregnant do a pregnancy test home pregnancy tests are fairly reliable within days of conception because if your period is not yet due  then it could be too early for test  so if the test is negative  repeat another test in about 1 week if you have not started your period yet if you are trying to get pregnant you should take folic acid 1 mg every day to prevent birth defects
1458,do pregnancy test if it is negative then it is common to miss periods on the depo shot
1459,can i be pregnant yes you can be pregnant i am sure you were advised of this risk when you chose depo i would advise a pregnancy test as long as the sexual risk was more than fourteen days ago
1460,possible its possible you should take a home pregnancy test they become positive by the time yore about a week late
1461,check your pill pack please check your pill pack to make sure you have not missed any pills missing your pills will increase your chances of getting pregnant and also making your periods irregular if you have not missed any pills  then you will not get pregnant as long as you have taken your pills on time daily if you continue to have irregular periods on your third pack  please contact your doctor
1462,unlikely although inconsistent use of birth control pills combined with multiple episodes of unprotected sex puts you at very high risk for pregnancy  the presence of your recent period  providing it was completely normal  makes it highly unlikely that you are pregnant
1463,pregnancy possible the possibility exists if you are one week late and still havent had your menses  you should perform a home pregnancy test
1464,pregnancy possible the possibility exists if you are one week late and still havent had your menses  you should perform a home pregnancy test
1465,wether wether or not antibiotics interacts with birth control pills is controversial i highly doubt that one antibiotic pill will interfere with your birth control some doctors tell their patients to use a back up method while on antibiotics and others do not as long as you take your pill everyday around the same time you should be safe best of luck
1466,depoprovera when in doubt  take a pregnancy test if you are having a period  however  you probably are not pregnant irregular bleeding is not unusual with depo
1467,no you wouldnt ovulate during a normal period also a fertilized egg could not implant while the uterus lining is shedding the egg only is viable for about one day your obgyn can answer your question if you still have further concerns
1468,yes it is always possible get a blood pregnancy test
1469,possible see a gyn for a blood preg test   if that is  after your missed period then you should not be preg
1470,yes protection with depo lasts 34 mos you should use a backup  get a test and then restart depo if you wish
1471,absolutely if you miss more than 1 pill per pack  in general you need to use back up birth control or abstain
1472,missed pill and had your period after sex  you are not pregnant
1473,yes you can if you miss 2 or more daily pills during a cycle you should either abstain from sex or use a backup method of contraception like a condom each type of pill is different  so check with your doctor to learn more i would use an emergency contraceptive in your case if taken within 3 days of unprotected sex  it reduces your chance of getting pregnant by 89%
1474,unlikely  but a urine pregnancy test  done correctly  gives a reliable result 3 weeks after sex 3 weeks after when conception might have occurred  or 1 week after missing a period if done sooner  a positive result is likely real  but a negative result may be due to testing too soon  and thus lead to a repeat test
1475,you may be pregnant but id also have the leg pain examined fort dvt = a clot go see your doctor
1476,pregnancy if you are sexually active   then yeas this is the first thing to rule out you may be pregnant
1477,home pg test do a home pg test  if negative repeat in one week if no menses
1478,take the test if you want to know if you are pregnant  take a test in todays world you do not need to wonder if you are pregnant or not based on symptoms pregnancy tests are available at any pharmacy and in minutes you will have your answer they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period
1479,possibly at your age  if yore in a sexual relationship  it is possible that you could be pregnant however  a normal early pregnancy doesnt cause the symptoms you describe while its ok to do a home pregnancy test  its more important that you be evaluated by a health care professional
1480,amenorrhea you are on birth control and took a test you are not pregnant dont understand the worry to waste more money on other tests your birth control  since you did not name it  could be the cause and perhaps your gynecologist will want to change brands or types of bc so you do not have this kind of unnecessary panic
1481,not necessarily experiencing cramps may still be part of premenstrual symptoms which you may still experience while on birth control often these symptoms can be lessened while on birth control but they dont necessarily go away completely if you skipped some bc pills and had unprotected sex you may want to take a pregnancy test  otherwise i would consider it normal
1482,pregnancy if your period is lighter than usual  pregnancy is a possibility a z pack may interfere with the efficacy of your birth control pills if there are questions so a pregnancy test now and if negative 1 week after your cycle dates all the best
1483,trust the test home pregnancy tests are very accurate they are the same tests used in a doctors office they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period if you doubt the result you can repeat it in 12 days if you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection see doc for irregular cycles
1484,yes it is possible oral diflucan or nystatin cream would help
1485,medical evaluation see a doctor to evaluate and treat you
1486,no no it will not
1487,yes lots of causes including not drinking enough water  climate dryness  medications  allergies and acid reflux if you suspect that you have a yeast infection see your doctor for a culture
1488,specifics there are twelve common stds ask him for specifics and get proof all boys trying to have sex say the are clean
1489,see details it depends on the area of the body involved by the yeast infection if it is vaginal  the answer is no
1490,hiv there are stds that can easily be gotten through oral sex you need to be tested for hiv as well as for other stds including syphilis  gonorrhea  chlamydia  etcif you are an hiv1 negative adult truvada may help reduce the risk of you getting hiv1 infection through sex if you are at high risk  but it is not 100% effective go and get seen and in future be protected better safe than sorry
1491,hiv risks i need more information how long did you take truvada for one month did you use any other hiv medications to prevent infection there is a very obvious source for your swollen lymph node so there is little to comment about except to clarify that one node is not in any way indicative of hiv infection
1492,yeast infection doxycycline may cause yeast overgrowth in the vagina the male sex partner may develop irritation upon sexual exposure 
1493,see details a lot of discharge with itching suggests vaginitis that is most likely from candida yeast you should be checked by your gyn there might be more that one infection the other symptoms can be from pms if your period is not due for a week  and you were pregnant  the egg just implanted and would not cause symptoms yet wait and see if you get your period do a pregnancy test if you dont
1494,possibly if the yeast causes you to be irratated enough it can cause a small amount of blood infections can be stressful to the vaginal wall as well as to the urethra see your doctor for the proper diagnosis if you are not certain it is yeast
1495,no not at all antiyeast cream only helps with yeast see a doctor for herpes medicine
1496,yes a irone test should also be accurate bit a blood test would certainly be an appropriate next step prior to doing any further testing or giving anyeds
1497,can although the infection is in your vagina  the cervix can get some irritation too and this is where the spotting comes from
1498,hard to tell but if you develop white cottage cheese type discharge  yes  that would be typical symptoms get to a doctor for more precise diagnosis
1499,fluids if you have been tested for stds the yeast and bv are possible if this occurs after sex it may just be sexual fluids especially if your make partner ejaculated in you
1500,vaginal itching see your gynacologist to rule out a trivhomonas infection
1501,pls c an allergist with such symptoms and initial therapy you received with limited improvement  you need to see a specialist  kindly check www acaaiorg and look for allergist locator to spot an allergist in your area  good luck
1502,sure try an over the counter yeast medication see doc if not improved
1503,infection probably nothing with uti or bladder infection a vaginal yeast infection can be transmitted specially if you are uncircumcised
1504,maybe you should see your doctor you can get a yeast infection  but it should clear up with medication such as diflucan  but you may have a medical problem e g diabetes that may prevent a rapid recovery
1505,for sure  no nothing is for sure but very likely thats why stds are so common because of easy spread through bodily fluids and direct contact always use protection unless for sure monogamous relationship and partners clear of all stds
1506,std transmission is highest with unprotected sex think carefully and wear a condom
1507,could be this could very well be related to a yeast infection so you could try for example clotrimazole or monistat over the counter however  this could be associated to other infections so would be prudent to see gyn provider for exam my other advise is to get a pregnancy test if you had unprotected sex
1508,ouch hi alice 646 cramping can sometimes follow more than usually vigorous intercourse  and as long as it doesnt last long and you have no other gi or vaginal pain  is probably functional unfortunately  penile vaginal intercourse can lead to yeast infections as well as frictional trauma consider using a lubricant treat the yeast  and consider condoms or a shared shower before intercourse
1509, cyst women can develop cyst fluid filled collections in the vagina that present as you describe however there is no way to know for sure without further eval make an appointment
1510,hormonal changes can put you at risk for yeast infection the time before  during and after your period is a time of hormonal change
1511,unprotected sex unless you are on some form of birth control you will have a chance of pregnancy with unprotected sex a condom is recommended to help protect against pregnancy some and to help protect against infections the clear vaginal discharge could be normal secretions
1512,yeast infection monistat will not hurt you
1513,yes you may shave  however i would allow at least 12 hours between shaving and using the cream to allow some healing of the area and hair growth beyond the follicle
1514,good hygiene  etc the best way to prevent this is probably good hygiene  like douching regularly and showering regularly it would also help to lessen the frequency of sex give your body a chance to rest and recover
1515,yes yo should not have sex during infection
1516,possible see your doctor for the specific diagnosis of your infection  then have your consort tested and treated
1517,anxiety symptoms are not a sign of illness  they are the minds ability to produce the flight or fight response which gives rise to many physiological changes include  heart palpitations  shortness of breath  fatigue  dry mouth  etc depending on the cause of your anxiety symptoms  your health care provider can provide you with treatment options
1518,er now alarming symptoms go to er now for assessment
1519,see doctor several things could be causing your symptoms: a plugged up milk duct in your breast  an infection mastitis  etc are you breastfeeding do you use any birth control method  if so what it would be best to have your doctor examine your breast and perhaps order a sonogram of the breast to see if a cause can be found
1520,symptomatic tachy seek help detailed history  pe  bloods  ecg additional testing pending above
1521,neurologic may be neurologic in origin please call your physician for an appointment
1522,low blood oxygen these are typical signs of sleep apnea  a condition which involve periods of ten seconds or more without breathing apnea and periods of time with shallow breathing and a significant decrease in blood oxygen levels hypopnia this condition can be diagnosed by a sleep specialist with either an overnight at home sleep test or at a sleep clinic utilizing a full psg
1523,feeling strange you need to confirm this with a live inperson doctor  but your symptoms sound like more or less gardenvariety migraines
1524,yes numbness and weakness in the right upper and lower extremities may indicate nerve compression at the level of the spine mri and emg could localize and prognosticate a compressive neuropathy and would give guidance to appropriate treatment options consult with a physical medicine and rehabilition specialist would be appropriate
1525,2 nerves one pinched nerve cant cause numbness in arm and leg so look for other causes  or multiple levels of disease
1526,numbness you might be having a problem with the nerves supplying your legs this can occur from injury  degeneration of the spine  or certain systemic diseases i would suggest evaluation by your primary physician who could refer you to a specialist in your area if need be
1527,semicrania headache you got migraine headache we call semicrania check blood test esr for possible temporal arteritis  see your doctor if not better in 37 days
1528,head ache i suspect a good part of the history is missing we have no other information about you such as your medical or mental health history  any trauma do you have any other symptoms such as light sensitivity  fever  nausea  shortness or breath  etc we also dont know how long the symptoms have been going on i suggest you consult your doctor for a physical exam and possible xrays and labs
1529,if new go to er if these symptoms just started and you have never had them before  and they still are present  call your doctor or go to an er now sudden onset of headache and numbness can be serious and needs to be checked out now
1530,nerve irritation something is irritating a nerve that sends sensation down your right arm could be a disc  could be a pinched nerve in a muscle in your neck thorcic outlet syndrome  could be inflamation of a group of nerve down your arm brchial plexitis
1531,migraine vs other despite your young age  if you have not had similar symptoms before and are still having these symptoms  this warrants prompt inperson physician evaluation to ruleout migraine versus other more serious causes of your symptoms stroke i see this question posted over 12hrs ago if your symptoms have resolved i would still let your doctor know so you can have a plan in place should this recur
1532,weak and dizzy i am sorry but for you the safest is to be evaluated in person although it may turn out to be not critical it would be terrible if you did need treatment
1533,numbness etc this strongly suggests some nerve damage from your neck down tell this to your primary doctor and ask for a rapid referral to a neurologist
1534,no there is no reason for it to go to the face  there are a different set of facial neves
1535,neuropathy you should contact your doctor asap  and get evaluated you may have a peripheral neuropathy or even lumbosacral spinal stenosis

1548,anxiety attack stress leads to anxiety as dr abe suggests  your symptoms are suggestive of hyperventilation which can be secondary to anxiety if you are frequently hyperventilating  you may need treatment for anxiety your symptoms are related to an decrease in carbon dioxide when you breath too fast one treatment is to breathe into a paper bag

1575,see dermatologist you need to give more details on the distribution of the rash such as whether it crosses the bridge of your nose i suspect what you may have is rosacea which is aggravated by any increase in core body temperature but on skin rash  one really needs to look at the lesions themselves to venture a guess

1589,see a doctor any hard lump in that area  wether its getting better or not  needs to be checked out to rule out cancer especially if it is hard and immovable
1590,see a neurologist i would go see a neurologist before writing these off as not migraines you may be having a specific type of migraine headache caused by nerve compression a neurologist will need to examine you and determine if they think this is the case if so  botox and potentially surgery could offer a more permanent solution than long term medication
1591,infections look over your whole arm  checking for breaks in the skin sometimes even the smallest breaks in the skin can lead to infections or swollen lymph nodes
1592,thinks its acne most physicians can distinguish acne from other illnesses  but if your physicians comfort level isnt enough to make the call  get a dermatology consult

1598,you need to see a do a doctor visit is necessary if you have not already consulted some one either an internist or neurologist can treat your migraine for which we have many good drugs  these drugs are called triptans like sumatriptan is one of them if you have not taken one of these you could take a combination of pain medcines containing aspirin or ibuprofen plus caffeine for temp relief till you see your doctor
1599,probably sounds like it it sounds like it might be infected too you should seek eval and get treated before it gets worse
1600,ear bite it does sound like an allergic reaction from an insect bite take an antihistamine  like zyrtec or claritin or even benadryl causes drowsiness and put cold packs cold towels to help with swelling the headaches r concerning for maybe a bite in the ear canal which can cause blockage  an infection if it doesnt improve with my recommendations please have your ear checked keep me posted
1601,bulging eyes i dont have a ready explanation but you must see an ophthalmologist
1602,need to see eye dr you need to have your eyes measured  to make sure they are actually protruding  beyond normal or if its just your bone structure anything that can increase what appears to be protrusion can also be tumors  masses  inflammation in the eye  or involving the optic nerve  chiasm  vein or muscles that requires imaging  and further workup also your thyroid antibody panels need to be repeated
1603,see a specialist i recommend you see a headache specialist this would have to be a neurologist who specializes in headaches management there are well over 2  000 causes of headaches even if you are depressed  this does not sound like a tension headaches that one would expect in someone who is depressed people with depression or anxiety usually complain of a headache like a band of tension across the forehead
1604,migraine prevention your mri showed that you are having migraines i think in this case it is not certain you have a migraine  but lets say for the moment you do perhaps some prevention of vascular migraine phenomena may help you this could be a blood pressure medicine like propranolol it has been used to prevent migraines
1605,bartholins cyst these cysts are common and aid in lubrication if painful have it addressed  but otherwise it can be observed
1606,may seek a second neurology opinion
1607,confusing migraine can cause white matter lesions on mri  but these are numerous and preferentially to the back of the brain migraine does not cause brain scars your one lesion may be a sign of an emerging process  and perhaps if ms is suspected  mri of neck could be added  and even spinal fluid test might be useful if unhappy with current opinion  might consider second opinion
1608,need to define ha you would need to fill out a headache diary and log so we can get an idea of your actual symptoms  frequency  and intensity of headaches in order to determine the best intervention for you its a process that can take time but is well worth it as opposed to a quick fix which usually never really works well i am a headache specialist and would be happy to work with you
1609,unless it draining keep it drychange dressing if indicated and get stitches out if they are not temporary when indicated by your surgeon dematologist hope this helps dr z
1610,notify your doctor diarrhea that is not improving after 23 days deserves a complete history and physical from a physician

1613,could be migraine if you tried a triptan  unlikely it will have any effect once headache present for more than 90 minutes cambia and ergot amines have possible efficacy late in course of headache do suggest seeing a neurologist and get this sorted out if migraine  meds to prevent headaches can be quite successful
1614,sinus i would also look for a sinus infection
1615,need more info interesting symptoms but not enough info to give you a reasonable answer please see your family physician soon
1616,yes if you have a uti then the fluconazole will not help and the infection will continue see your doctor or urgent care to get proper diagnosis and treatment
1617,it depends on amount of swelling bee  wasp stings can actually continue to swell after the 24 hour mark apply ice in 10 min increments 10 on 10 off if you have swelling that is greater than 4 inches for one sting  and it isnt resolving consider medical attention
1618,headaches that are similar to migraine can occur after head trauma  even mild head trauma see your doctor to discuss treatment and to also ensure that nothing more serious is the case
1619,parathesia this is an unfortunate risk for wisdom teeth extraction and fortunately it is rare for your situation  please follow up with your treating dentist or oral surgeon

1621,migraine  many patients with pain in the sinus area of the face or around the eyes are often diagnosed with a “sinus headache ” however  recent epidemiological studies revealed that 4262% of patients with these symptoms met the ihs criteria for migraine without aura but received a diagnosis of “sinus headaches” resulting in incorrect treatment rec see headache or orofacial pain specialist
1622,take the test if you want to know if you are pregnant  take a test in todays world you do not need to wonder if you are pregnant or not based on symptoms pregnancy tests are available at any pharmacy and in minutes you will have your answer they can detect a pregnancy 710 days after conception the best time to take one is when you miss your period
1623,strep throat if you are concerned that you have strep throat  see you doctor he she may be able to do a screening test strep needs to be treated with antibiotics all the best
1624,difficult issue viral agents cause most of the issues you report  but strep is still possible you are still in an age group where untreated strep might lead to significant heart kidney and nervous system complications down the road if untreated even strep may feel better in a day or two  but feeling better doesnt change the risk time for you to go see doc
1625,ess is using endoscopes and other instruments in the nose to enlarge narrowed sinus openings  generally with the surgical field magnified and visualized on a large screen
1626,a procedure it is a procedure where a camera is used to unblock your sinus openings and remove infection  polyps or mucous that is stuck within your nose and sinuses for more information visit wwwsocalsinuscom
1627,sinus surgery basically its sinus surgery done with an endoscope through the nostrils to treat recurrent sinus infections or nasal polyps more details with pictures at wwwsocalsinuscom
1628,sinus surgery it is the term for the current method of sinus surgery functional refers to opening up the obstructed sinuses endoscopic means using a 4 mm endoscopic that is usually attached to a camera  thus it can be done all through your nostril and bilateral means both sides if you still have questions about what your surgeon plans to do  you should make another appt before surgery to review
1629,depends if you are asking what it would cost to pay for the procedure in cash without insurance you have to factor in three fees first the surgeon anywhere from 2  000 to 30  000 or more  then the facility 5  000 to 50  000 and anesthesia 1  000 to 10  000 new york city will be extremely expensive whereas south dakota would be much less when paying cash make sure to shop around
1630,sinus surgery sinus surgery is usually covered by insurance plans  so the out of pocket cost is just your deductible
1631,yes yes
1632,yes ask your ent doctor if you are an appropriate candidate for endoscopic sinus surgery yes it is possible
1633,endoscopic=cameras endoscopic sinus surgery is sinus surgery done with cameras  and usually done via the nostrils for access no incisions almost 100% of all sinus surgery is done endoscopically because it offers better visualization of the sinuses  no incisions  faster recovery  less bleeding  the list goes on rarely an incision is necessary for severe sinus disease  but this is easily <1%
1634,minimally invasive endoscopic sinus surgery means using a telescope with a camera to look in the nose while doing surgery it makes the surgery safer and easier
1635,camera assisted work arthroscopic knee surgery involves operating on the knee to remove  repair  or replace different injured structures without making big incisions a small 1 4 inch incision is made first and a small camera the diameter of a pencil is inserted into the knee to look around the inside of the knee is observed on a tv screen while the procedure is carried out through additional small incisions
1636,see below it is wear 23 small incisions are made around the knee so that a small camera can be introduced to view the structures thru the other incision instruments can be placed to remove bone or cartilage if needed
1637,you may you may have some uncomfortable pressure to deal with  but very unlikely pain you should ask that question of your surgeon good luck from nyc
1638,meniscus best to consult your orthopedic surgeon
1639,septoplasty dns  sinus surgery can resolve chronic sinusitis and mouth breathing
1640,no endoscopic means that they will take a thin tube with a camera and do it that way usually no scars or change in appearance it is minimally invasive and usually has suction and other tools to do the procedure hope this answer helps
1641,no ask your surgeon about the details  or any other question
1642,dislocation it is for patella dislocation and it can be done both arthroscopic and open
1643,good question this is very patient dependent and it requires an honest discussion with your ent doctor if you have failed maximal medical therapy  then surgery is the next best step however you still might need to take sinus medication to control the sinus disease ideally surgery will decrease the need for oral antibiotics but you still might need nasal steroids
1644,sinusitis greetings the question you pose is very common to hear the treatment offered depends on a lot of considerations is chronic sinusitis the true diagnosis have you been treated with maximal medical therapy have you been evaluated by a board certified ent surgeon who has a great deal of experience operating on nasal and sinuses after these questions are answered  then maybe the answer is yes
1645,24 weeks 24 weeks is reasonable
1646,fess endoscopic sinus surgery is of variable duration the actual time of the surgery depends on the surgeon and on how many sinuses are operated on and if any adjunct procedures are performed
1647,laser eye surgery it is possible with some laser platforms to do corneal refractive laser surgery on a patient with nystagmus if that is what you mean by rapid eye movement  in order to correct myopia surface ablation   prk would likely be the best choice  if the rest of the evaluation indicates the procedure would be safe for that patient
1648,discuss that with  your surgeon  as every surgeon has his own methods preferred meds  etc
1649,18 and older lasik is fdaapproved for those 18 and older more importantly  surgery is held off until there is no appreciable change in your prescription from year to year cataract surgery can be done at any age  and refractive lens surgery is similar to lasik  usually reserved for those over the age of 18
1650,depends depending upon state laws which dictate the age of majority  generally corrective laser surgery has the best results in the 20 to 35 year population there are exceptions  but as one approaches 40   presbyopia and the need for reading glssses in addition to the correction makes the procedure less attractive as an option
1651,varies each ortho has their own protocol by the end of 1 yr u will not improve much anymore
1652,yes infections in the head  including ear infections  sinus infections  and tooth infections  can lead to swelling of the lymph nodes and pain from the inflammation they usually take a few days to a few weeks to fully resolve please see your doctor if they are especially large and painful  or if your neck hurts when you bend it toward your chest
1653,unusual otitis media ear infection or rhinosinusitis rarely cause neck pain or cervical lymphadenopathy certainly this is possible and only means that the lymph nodes are a protective mechanism to prevent further spread of this viral bacterial infection
1654,depends on severity depends on the severity of the deviation and the degree of blockage initially decongestants and steroids will i taille be used in combination with antibiotics if needed
1655,not important the septum effects breathing and in some cases can occlude areas in the nasal cavity where the sinuses drain this latter case may contribute to chronic sinusitis however the septum has very little influence on sinus infection and no role in ear infection
1656,yes and no if you have both deviated septum and sinus problems then you will need endoscopic surgery deviated septum repair is a more conventional surgery  and it depends on the severity of the deviated septum if you have sinus problems  be sure your ent has gotten a ct scan to evaluate your sinuses so that you avoid two invasive procedures
1657,not really a deviated septum can be fixed during the course of endoscopic sinus surgery ess or on its own its usually fixed through a small incision in the nose for patients with nasal obstruction
1658,no pain should go away within a few weeks be sure to followup with your surgeon or get a second opinion
1659,information it is notural to have a funny nose after such surgery for several weeks it should gradually decrease
1660,could be you could also just have a cold or nasal allergies  you need to see a doctor for proper diagnosis
1661,not sure the symptoms of viral and bacterial sinusitis are essentially the same viral illnesses peak then usually resolve within 714 days sinus infections usually are worsening symptoms over time so that the illness escalates in intensity or are either symptoms that fluctuate and persist for more than 34 weeks up to 60% of bacterial sinusitis will clear without antibiotics so waiting is important
1662,1 week in you should start feeling improvement about 1 week in if its responding to the medications can add sudafed to your regimen to help with the pressure in the meanwhile
1663,if problematic you would benefit from surgery it sounds as if this is the case
1664,not necessarily you should be evaluated by a reputable ent specialist these cysts are common and may not be contributing to what you are experiencing
1665,yes both conditions can cause your problem do note that sinus surgery would help if you have obstruction at the sinus openings else you should consult an allergist prior to undergoing the surgery
1666,allergies yes allergies and  or sinus infections can cause achiness  neck and ear pain
1667,allergies allergies can make your ears ache from congestion  your neck pain can be from swollen lymph nodes check with your doctor to see if you have an infection
1668,sinus symptoms yes  infections such as this one may cause many of these symptoms especially when there are flares of the infection fever and sinus drainage should also be symptoms for sinusitis
1669,still healing the normal lymphatic drainage of the nasal and septal mucosa skin inside the nose takes quite a long time to recover occasionally dont give up hope  this will likely improve atropine nasal spray could be used temporarily if this is really bothering you
1670,runny nose depends how long ago since you had the septoplasty be patient adn go back to your surgeon if it didnt improve over the coming weeks
1671, pots although there is very little other information  you could possibly have paroxysmal orthostatic tachycardia syndrome the increase in heart rate would in particular occur upon standing this can be accompanied by associated decrease in blood pressure  with lightheadedness  fatigue  excessive thirst if chronic  can prompt cold extremities  shortness of breath  headache  restless sleep  gi symptom
1672,go to er now you are exhibiting signs of what we call sepsis  a very serious infection that could kill you tonight this does not wait until morning sign off computer and call someone to take you to er now or call 911 do not wait until organs start to fail to get evaluated and treatment started off computer now and right to nearest hospital emergency room go now and gods speed
1673,heart rate nothing if no symptoms
1674,your md can tell you if you have been exercizing aerobically your rest pulse might be under 60 if not or you are dizzy or light headed see your md asap your pulse should go up with exercize if you are young and very fit you might be able to pass 200 since you onlyleft a little info i think you should talk to an md he she may reasure you or have you see an excercize physiologist or recommend a stress test
1675,borderline low some perfectly healthy people have blood pressure readings like you mention and feel normal for other people these levels are low enough to causes dizziness or lightheadedness i would suggest getting up slowly and if symptoms persist  call your doctor
1676,odd combosee dr the sleep issue  diet  dizziness  lbp do not conveniently fit together to give an easy answer you need to be seen and examined by a provider who can get a good history and put the pieces together  and order tests if necessary  to see what is going on and why
1677,tia vs hyperventilat presence of headache with high bp and unilateral sensory changes requires considering transient ischemic strokes or a cva other causes could be hyperventilation as a consequence of pain leading to secondary tingling though would expect that to be bilateral and not localizing to one side
1678,yes consult with your doctor as soon as possible 
1679,yes although dizziness and disorientation can be caused by other problems  low blood pressure is a common cause
1680,a blessing  yes  you are more likely to feel dizzy or faint with a low baseline blood pressure  having said that  low blood pressure is generally more of a blessing than a concern  just make sure that you take care of your health like anyone else with exercise and healthy lifestyle 
1681,indirectly i cant say for sure but either the pain of an injection or your watching it may cause what is called a vasovagal reaction this reaction causes a drop in heart rate which in turn causes a drop in blood pressure which causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain in your case potentially starting with low blood pressure you may not tolerate any further drop
1682,check up you need a good checkup
1683,medication dose you may need to call your md may have the need for dose adjustment or stopping some further based on your risk factors you may need testing to ensure there are no heart issues a call to your md is needed soon
1684,better with lying if it is completely better with lying down  it may be a symptom of intracranial hypotension while this is not a serious condition  it is a problem with have a headache whenever you stand it it is definitely positional in nature  you will want to explain this to a doctor who can see you in person and help you get the right treatment for it it is probably not caused by your blood pressure
1685,heart condition this is likely a heart condition that needs to be evaluated asap when the heart is not working efficiently or effectively  the heart may not pump as fast as it should or as strong as it should this will limit blood flow equaling low blood pressure this will cause less blood flow going to the brain and hence causing dizziness
1686,md visit a first step in the management of these symptoms is to have your cardiopulmonary condition assessed pulmonary arterial hypertension should be considered in the work up
1687,dont know it could be your thyroid  an autoimmune disease  just your heart  a lung heart circulation problem   see a physician and get to work at getting to the bottom of it
1688,not always low blood pressure is only an issue if you are symptomatic with it common sx included fainting or feeling extremely dizzy going from a seated or recumbent position virtually all studies suggest an lower   mi or ashd risk the lower the bp it should only be treated if you have sx
1689,fainting low blood pressure is usually a part of fainting
1690,rheumatologist you need to be properly examined by a rheumatologist  tested for lyme disease if appropriate exposure  and tested for cardiac and other issues realted to your blood pressure
1691,see below 60 90 is not a blood pressure the bottom number cannot be greater than the top number your pressure is probably 90 60 this can be normal in a 28 year old woman
1692,depends that blood pressure reading alone  without symptoms  is normal for a female your age symptoms such as dizziness  fainting  lightheadedness  could result from low blood pressure fatigue can too  although its more difficult to ascertaining a cause effect relationship
1693,sorry but 99 90 doesnt make sense as pulse pressure of 9 is too small please recheck or repost
1694,htn your diastolic pressure 90 is elevated  needs to be checked recommend er to be on safe side
1695,blood donation the low blood pressure and increased heart rate are not unusual post blood donation fever is unusual and if you arent cooking up a cold and it isnt gone promptly  id consult your dr
1696,blood donation the low blood pressure and increased heart rate are not unusual post blood donation fever is unusual and if you arent cooking up a cold and it isnt gone promptly  id consult your dr
1697,yes very glad your bp and cholesterol are normal  but your weight at its current level could be an additional risk factor for other medical problems would be worthwhile for you to see your doctor and possibly a dietician to get into a long term comprehensive program that would help you to lose weight and keep it off good luck
1698,ddimer the ddimer test is helpful in diagnosing a pe  but not definitive and required to have same see the lung dr with your symptoms and assure you get a complete and continuing work up of your issues best wishes
1699,workup mgt a pulmonary embolism is possible your symptoms may also be caused by an irregular heart beat  infection  asthma  heart disease  underlying lung fibrosis and other possible conditions your physician will most likely order an ekg  chest radiograph  pulmonary function testing and pulse oximetry this will help to determine the underlying cause an ed visit is advised
1700,probably not i dont think a service dog would be of much help to you instead  you need to be evaluated for correctable causes of dizziness if there are none  a cane or walker may be help
1701,pleurisy that is typically more related to your lungs and can be something as benign as pleurisy or something more serious such as a blood clot to the lungs if you feel short of breath  have rapid heart rate  or are in any other way concerned you should be evaluated right away if you are unsure then call your doctors office and be connected to the doctor on call
1702,chest pain it could be either or related to the chest wall complete history and physical is necessary
1703,beta blockers better it sounds as if you may have a condition called inappropriate sinus tachycardia this may be confirmed by your physician it is best treated with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers ablation may also be an option i would avoid clonidine due to side effects
1704,only way to know for sure is to measure it when you have symptoms but it could also be low blood pressure or anemia have it checked out by a doctor
1705,dont assume as hypoglycemia is vanishingly rate symptoms include nervousness  sweating  hunger  anxiety  blurred vision  fatigue  fast heart rate  etc  however unless you have diabetes and are on insulin or other medication  have renal or liver disease  cancer or prior stomach surgery  then true hypoglycemia never occurs in human beings if it a very frequently and incorrectly made diagnosis
1706,blood pressure you can increase the fluids and salt in your diet  wear support hose and pay attention when you are standing up to do it slowly
1707,stand slower you are experiencing what is called orthostatic hypotension  which can actually cause you to pass out some medications or dehydration can exaggerate this response drink lots of water  take lots of time when standing  and talk to your physician
1708,blood pressure you can increase the fluids and salt in your diet  wear support hose and pay attention when you are standing up to do it slowly
1709,right theres no relationship between anxiety and diabetes theres no relationship between your bp and your heart rate and diabetes either there is a relationship to your weight and how much you exercise  so try to be at ideal weight and exercise regularly exercise is also very good for anxiety so you can kill 2 birds with 1 stone
1710,exam see you doctor for a good exam and see if you any investigations to help diagnose the cause of your dizziness and head pressure make sure you have your blood pressure checked all the best
1711,serious enough this is fairly important to deal with if it is from your adrenal gland  you might need endocrine tests see endocrinologist to ascertain the cause it might be due to a pituitary hormone chemical causing the adrenal to overproduce whatever hormone causing your high bp see your doctor to discuss it more and try to get to an endocrinologist to find out
1712,hypertension the cause of your high blood pressure can be due to a few hormonal chemical imbalances that would warrant further discussion with your doctor to better understand what may be the cause this may necessitate medical or surgical therapy depending on the cause
1713,sounds like lousy diet and concomitant vitamin deficiency
1714,fluid it is likely that this is fluid not all middle ear fluid is infected  you can just have fluid without an associated infection infections usually have associated pain and or fever best way to determine if an infection is present is for someone to look at it and see if there is redness and or if the fluid present is cloudy and pussy

1888,no it would promote yeast infection
1889,topical cortisone otc hydrocortisone cream for a few days may help but your problem will not go away until you stop using the agent which has provoked the redness

1910,depends recovery fro simple knee arthroscopy meniscal debridement  loose body removal  plica excision takes ~6 wks if you rehab diligently you can get back faster sports in 34 weeks arthroscopic ligament reconstruction eg acl  meniscus repairs  or articular cartilage procedures microfracture  aci  etc require longer rehabilitation  often 612 months talk to your surgeon about your case
1911,it varies if you have a meniscus tear only  once you trim the tear  you many not ever have any future problems due to the loss of a portion of your shock absorber  however  you may develop secondary arthritis in the future which means the cartilage on the ends of the bones can start to wear down this may take years or decades to happen if it happens at all
1912,internal knee issues knee swelling and pain with squatting are common findings with meniscal tears knee pain with stairs is usually related to degenerative cartilage behind the knee cap an orthopedic surgeon can evaluate your knees and help determine what is causing your pain

1914,depends 1 how extensive was disease 2 what technique was used to remove disease >ablation >excision for either technique  disease is often left behind  particularly microscopic disease and is generally recommended to use postoperative medical therapy adjuvant like luprondanocrine to burn away any residual disease
1915,let me explain when you have the surgery for cartilage tear  you could also some arthritis in the knee that could the cause of the pain  check with the surgeon for to see if they found any changes in the joint during the arthroscopy
1916,arthritis chondrosis it depends on the reason you had surgery you could have ongoing osteoarthritis that can continue to bother patients after arthroscopy if you had any chondromalacia that can cause persistent knee discomfort even after arthroscopy also if you had ligament reconstruction there could be other reasons as well any significant functional limitations should be evaluated by your surgeon
1917,knee cap issues the symptoms you describe are indicative of pain originating in the cartilage on the underside of the knee cap patella this condition is called chondromalacia patella treatment involves ice packs and nsaia for the pain hamstring stretching and quad balancing exercises help correct the problem cartilage heals slowly though weight loss can help tremendously
1918,minimally invasive the laparoscopy and cholecystectomy are quite common several small openings are made to introduce the camera and surgical tools if the prior surgery on the right side entered the abdomen  there may be adhesions that limit access to the gallbladder open cholecystectomy is a well established procedure  and can be done with much smaller incisions than historically

1921,means surgery will probably be the only thing that can treat it a torn meniscus means you have torn the cartilage ring of tissue that sits between your femur and tibia in the knee joint if it is displaced that means it has torn and a flap of tissue is shifted to the middle of the knee joint
1922,stuck in joint a displaced meniscus tear is the leading cause of a locked knee the meniscus gets into a position like something jammed in a door hinge that doesnt allow it to close sometimes it requires the knee to be manipulated to unlock it arthroscopy surgery is the final solution
1923,sometimes for severe chondromalacia of the patella in which there is extensive exposed bone  knee replacement is an option
1924,last resort treatmen running causes high forces in this portion of the joint so does arising from a chair  going up down stairs treatment consists of activity modification  ice  antiinflammatory meds and therapy aimed at flexibility and strengthening  especially of your core doubt knee replacement would be needed unless other compartments of knee also arthritic patellofemoral replacement as a last resort
1925,do u feel better your description is very general go for 2 nd opinion if you dont feel better or discuss with your surgeon
1926,more info sounds like you may have a tear of the root or horn of your meniscus root tears with pain and mechanical symptoms or swelling may require surgery depending on how it is torn really determines if it can be fixed repairs in patients older than 40 typically dont do well so usually this is partially removed root tears in general can lead to progressive arthritis and arent good tears to have
1927,meniscal tear a displaces meniscal root means a meniscal tear most of the time this requires arthroscopic surgery to repair
1928,surgery most mcl injuries r not treated with surgery unless some bone was avulsed and bracing does well 3 wks is a little 2 soon 2 b healed
1929,therapy chondromalacia patella runners knee is due to overload of the patellofemoral joint knee cap against the end of the thigh bone running caused high forces in this portion of the joint so does arising from a chair  going up down stairs treatment consists of activity modification  ice  antiinflammatory meds and therapy aimed at flexibility and strengthening  especially of your core
1930,camera assisted work arthroscopic knee surgery involves operating on the knee to remove  repair  or replace different injured structures without making big incisions a small 1 4 inch incision is made first and a small camera the diameter of a pencil is inserted into the knee to look around the inside of the knee is observed on a tv screen while the procedure is carried out through additional small incisions
1931,see below it is wear 23 small incisions are made around the knee so that a small camera can be introduced to view the structures thru the other incision instruments can be placed to remove bone or cartilage if needed
1932,post surgical until proven otherwise   after acls surgwry is post surgical   neednto talk tothe ortho
1933,be patient takes awhile for bone healing  then pt over the course of time some pain and swelling to be expected
1934,pcl and lcl you should have an orthopedic surgeon to see if you would benefit from surgical repair

1936,anterior knee pain knee noise does not correlate with knee pathology chondromalacia means cartilage softening and is thus a surgical diagnosis not a clinical diagnosis obtain a current diagnosis of your anterior knee pain to plan treatment
1937,non weight bearing micro fracture in essence is creating a fracture to stimulate fibro cartilage to fill in a void this needs to be protected from load for a minimum 46 weeks  once the micro fracture heals you can progress your weight bearing early pt will focus on range of motion strengthening without loading the joint  typically flexion past 90 is avoided in the short term depending on the region of the fx
1938,microfracture normal to be nervous with any surgery you will have some pain that should be easily managed with pain medication you will be on crutches for 46 weeks a brace is usually not rquired good luck
1939,infection typically a burning sensation in the vagina implies a yeast or bacterial infection you should see your gynecolologist and get tested sometimes during ones cycle  its difficult to describe the type of discharge yore having and you need some lab testing to determine the cause
1940,steps anesthesia  small port openings  introduce carbon dioxide to allow exposure  introduce devices to view and work  visualize abnormalities  cauterize  remove  drain  lyse adhesions  remove cysts are all possibilities  then close port sites
1941,post tka pain the most severe pain is in the first 48 hrs it should gradually start lessening after that it depends upon how much deformity is there preop also pain is a subjective measure usually minimal pain by a month
1942,it may not be gone some are fortunate to have the surgery and shortly there after once the wounds healed  they have no pain at all many will have great improvement of pain  but never completely resolved after the replacement surgery it is a big surgical procedure with significant risks benefits  so do your research and discuss with doc thoroughly good luck to you
1943,it means you may be very allergic
1944,swelling it is not uncommon to have swelling below the knee after surgery however  it is always wise to consult your surgeon
1945,speak to ur surgeon any area downstream of an injury or surgery is susceptible to swelling in the short term the increased swelling around your knee can slow down the blood flow coming from your foot resulting in swelling also  decreased weight bearing and movement in that leg slows fluid return form the foot this is most likely  but speak to your surgeon immediately to rule out other causes like a blood clot
1946,yes displaced meniscus tears usually require surgery
1947,see an orthopedist if you have not already  take the advice of a qualified orthopedic surgeon and have this attended to it will only get worse if you ignore it

1949,ent need further evaluation for headache nausea dizziness
1950,incision  scope  cut anesthetize area  insert scope thru small incision  establish problem after washing out cloudy fluid with sterile clear soln  insert thin surgical tool like scissor  correct prob done for torn meniscal cartilage  ant cruciate ligament  remove loose fragments or inflamed tissue recovery time depends on proc and ortho: 18 wks anesthesia reax  infection  clots  fluid reaccum: generally safe
