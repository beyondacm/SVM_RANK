235,reglan+tylenol! 10 mg of metoclopramide (reglan) taken with 1  000 mg of acetamoniphen (tylenol) at the onset of migraine-type headache aborts the painful episode in the majority of cases as well as tryptans at a small fraction of the cost and with no known pregnancy effects (i e safe throughout pregnancy) do not take more than 2-3 times in a day and discuss with your obstetrician if that could work for you!

270,need mamogram/ultra this can be a number of things breast pain is not a common presenting symptom of breast cancer  but can occur breast pain during menses is common due to enlargement of the breast ducts during the estrogen surge i would have a mammogram or ultrasound if you have a painful lump  although this is usually due to fibrocystic disease
271,unlikely enlarged lymph nodes can be due to cancer but in that case they typically are painless infection related enlargement of nodes is often tender if the nodes do not settle down in 2-3 weeks  you should get checked by your primary care doctor

278,depends ask your doctor how dilated the bile duct is after gallbladder removal  it is normal to have a slightly enlarged bile duct additionally  as you age  your bile duct usually enlarges a bit  usually about 1 mm per 10 years if you have stones in your bile duct  you certainly need to have this addressed finally  proving that your pain is from the dilated bile duct is quite difficult
279,important info the mammogram (mg) and ultrasound(us) show breast tissue in different ways the mg is better for women with fatty breasts the us can help tell if a mass is solid or cystic (fluid filled) it can also give a better picture for women who have dense breasts the tests are often used together to help determine what is going on

282,possibly if you had the diagnostic mammogram for something you can feel  like a lump  then you will almost certainly need an ultrasound if you were called back for calcifcations  you most likely will not need an ultrasound if a mass was seen on the mammogram  that you cannot feel  you will also need an ultrasound

285,consult orthopedics this sounds like a complicated orthopedic surgery problem you should consult an orthopedic surgeon the swelling and symptoms you describe are certainly not normal and suggest a major joint problem exam  x-rays  and mri will likely be needed treatments could include therapy  bracing  anti-inflammatory meds  injections  and possibly surgery you should not let this persist
286,agree with dr garber if you are on  or just finished your period  urine will show blood blood means red cells  without white cells uti ( infection) is much less likely need to recheck urine to make sure blood is not still there if still  with protein  need a nephrologist  if blood without protein in urine  need a urologist
287,not known 4 sure coxsackie virus can be transmitted by nasal  salivary discharges  as well as by the blister-like rash that may appear  and by stool (poop) so even when the rash disappears  the virus can still be shed in the poop for weeks wash hands well!
288,not usually perm lesion can mean many things-in this case  it refers to the location of what is causing your problem the ulnar nerve has several functions with one being sensation to the 4th and 5th fingers so numbness and tingling suggests the ulnar nerve is irritated  confirmed by the emg most common is from pressure at the funny bone where the ulnar nerve travelsoften stopping pressure cures it
289,sound vs xrays mammograms use xrays to image the breast tissue screening mmgs involve 2 views (mlo  cc) of each whole breast ultrasound uses sound waves to produce images of the breast tissue the area visualized is dependent upon where the probe is placed on the breast and is influenced by how it is angled  how fast it is moved around and how much attention is being paid to the screen during the exam
290,panic attack? the symptoms you had  can occur with a panic attack  some panic attacks seem to come out of the blue  but others may have environmental triggers it would also be important to know whether any physical violence was happening in this fighting you & your husband might benefit from couple's counseling so that disagreements don't get to this point -- and it may help you to see your doctor too
291,melatonin possible but not likely  if it was working when taken regularly
292,stiff pip 1 arthritis is a common cause of stiffness of these joints 2 often a trigger finger will give the feeling that this joint is sore and stiff 3 often the two problems arise in the same finger each exacerbating the other
293,more commonly viral viral infections are much more common and likely causing your symptom complex  but it is difficult to tell for sure if your throat is red  with pus  and swollen  you should have it checked for possible strepthroat otherwise  viral is likely and symptoms will get better in a few days motrin/tylenol  and sorethroat spray to help your symptoms consult doc if you get worse good luck
294,uncommon  age if the partial knee replacement is performed correctly  one should expect it to last for many years at the age of 38  you still need to avoid running for excercise  just as for a full knee replacement if indicated  much better option for you at your very young age
295,see your doctor please contact your physician immediately regarding this condition this could be related to your epidural or an injury to your sciatic nerve
296,trigger fingers? sounds like trigger fingers the inflammation should first be treated and if this fails to resolve the condition  further evaluation may be warranted with possible surgery
297,early am stiffness a common problem for joint issues in the hand no matter what the cause the important thing is make sure that you work out the stiffness each and every day warm soaks warm showers and exercises such as the classic hand six pack exercises especially working on making a full fist and working on flexing the joints fully remember warm to warm up at the beginning of the day and ice after activity
298,loss of urine stress incontinence is losing urine without meaning to during physical activity  such as coughing  sneezing  laughing  or exercise stress incontinence may occur from weakened pelvic muscles that support the bladder and urethra or because the urethral sphincter is not working correctly this could be caused by: childbirth  medications  obesity  smoking stress incont is much more common in women
299,if you have had a blood draw or iv injection  a sclerosed vein the u/s can tell characteristics of the lump  solid  cystic or fluid filled need to check other nodes list medsdrug reaction only biopsy can discern what is in a node
300,several ways some of this depends on what part of the leg is affected and the underlying cause treatments include medicine  injection therapy  pt  spinal cord stimulation and further surgery
301,sore throat you may have any number of problems  including infected wisdom teeth  periodontal (gum and bone) disease  or other soft tissue infection(s) advanced tooth decay and abscess could cause pain and this much local soft tissue inflammation but the other conditions are equally important to identify and treat see a dentist or oral surgeon immediately
302,i don't think so i would have it checked out by a doctor
303,yes there are many causes for missing a period in addition to pregnancy common causes are stress  heavy exercise  weight changes  travel  thyroid problems or other hormone changes if you are worried about pregnancy  and the first test is negative  repeat it in a few days
304,it can be this is most likely a stitch dissolving and coming out to the surface you need to see your surgeon it may require some short term antibiotics
305,yes it means the origin of the tumor is from the breast it is a primary breast cancer that has spread or metastasized to the lung
306,sometimes there are lesions that can be determined with a high level of assurance to be benign and lesions that can be determined to be malignant  there are also many lesions that cannot be determined with a high degree of certainty with these sstudies alone
307,normal all pregnancies are different not all women have the same symptoms so do t worry about the breast tenderness at 10 wks your uterus is still i side the pelvis at 20 wks your uterus will be at the belly bottom and you will start feeling movement
308,leak w/pressure stress incontinence is due to a combination of weak ligaments and weak pelvic muscles commonly associated w/weakness caused by vaginal childbirth but can occur in women who've not given birth the most common treatments are kegels or pelvic muscle exercise muscles can be too weak to exercise on your own; pelvic floor pt is the best method minimally invasive surgery can restore ligament support
309,call ob gyn the on call doctor will answer you question
310,depends could be either seizures frequently have loss of conciousness  and no pain; but panic attacks do not usually have headache  either see a doctor
311,ice and elevate sounds like this is a reaction to the sting i'd recommend ice  elevating your foot  using nsaids (like ibuprofen)  and benadryl
312,maybe it is possibe that this could still be benign  it sounds like the docs are checking up on an abnormal mammogram finding if it was highly suspicious  you would have already have had a biopsy hopefully you will get the results soon - get a biopsy if needed  or hopefully  be reassured that it looks ok and have appropriate follow-up scheduled
313,allergies it sounds like you have allergic rhinitis  not a virus you should take allergy medicine  like claritin  allegra or zyrtec  with the decongestant if you don't have high blood pressure or see your doctor about a nasal steroid spray
314,check with your doc a mammogram is a screening tool & an ultrasound and magnified views of a breast area would have given the radiologist more information if no concerning areas are found  your doc has to correlate your risk factors with your clinical exam to decide if a repeat in 6 months is appropriate do this first & if still concerned  then feel free to seek a second opinion take good care of yourself
315,yes for purposes of dental insurance  any thing done to enhance the smile in absence of decay or fracture is considered cosmetic and usually not covered the only exception would be if you have orthodontic coverage
316,sounds like sciatica this sounds like a typical case of a sciatica or pain radiating into the leg due to a nerve compression that can be due to a disc herniation usually but there can be other explanations generally this is true with pain that goes past the knee and can be confirmed on exam and by imaging with a ct scan or mri most get better without surgery
317,anxiety start meditation & relaxation with imagery  by closing your eyes & visualizing going thru the visit practice breathing exercises keep in mind also that most of us have similar anxiety since we are not sure what the doctor is going to tell us  or if we will hear bad news seeing a therapist for cognitive behavior therapy does help as well
318,call your doctor if this is really purely due to the radiation pneumonitis  prednisone may help (as outpatient) you would want to be sure there is no concomitant infection or any other problem your doctor should be able to help you with this
319,moles and cancer moles & melanoma  one form of skin cancer  come from same cells in skin  melanocytes  that make a pigment (melanin) that gives skin its tan/brown pigmentation melanocytes are also in the eye  inner ear & heart moles are benign collections of melanocytes some moles  like large congenital moles can develop melanoma most melanomas develop on normal skin any changing mole needs to be examined
320,sleep on your side if you are a mild snorer  sleeping on your side may be all you need to do a bumper belt can help if your snoring is more vigorous  you may have sleep apnea you need to see your doctor who can order a sleep study if you have sleep apnea options usually include a cpap  surgery or a special dental appliance a dental appliance should only be provided by a dentist trained in dental sleep medicine
321,yes and no pelvic prolapse and urinary incontinence are two distinct entities that often occur together in some circumstances pelvic prolapse reduces urinary incontinence due to increased urethral pressures surgeons often discuss issues of future incontinence when treating prolapse a complete pelvic floor evaluation is important when planning surgery to avoid these issues
322,tmj pain around th ear and the jaw following tonsillectomy is probably a result of keeping the mouth wide open for a long time during the surgery which puts lots of strain on the temptomsndibular joint (tmj) and the muscles that are involved with this joint talk to your dentist there are exercises that you can do to ease the pain there are also muscle relaxing and pain med you can take
323,bad breath see your ent for post nasal drip meanwhile use a tongue scraper to clean your tongue few times per day because the bacterial can sit and harbor on top of your tongue perpetuating the bad breath
324,damaged muscles childbirth can be traumatic to the muscles and nerves surrounding the bladder  vagina and rectum the nerves can be damaged and small tears in the muscles can lead to prolapse and incontinence is some women it's nothing to be embarrassed about it is common and fixable
325,not your heart those tests have pretty much ruled out your heart as the cause of your symptoms
326,sounds like prolapse considering your history and the symptoms that you describe you probably do have some type of prolapse many women can feel something bulging through the vaginal opening to check  place fingers at the vaginal opening while seated on a toilet and bear down as if you are trying to have a bowel movement your doctor could determine exactly what parts are dropping and discuss treatment options
327,remember the moa as an aside  it's important to remember how these meds work your allergies are caused by histamine release in the body antihistamines block the release of histamine  not its effects its important therefore to take allergy medicine prior to experiencing the allergy symptoms antihistamines are to prevent allergy symptoms  not get rid of them once they've already shown up
328,maybe both but usually when sinuses get infected the upper teeth become sore  the infection in the sinus can creat pressure which can push against the root of the teeth hence the sensitivity and soreness the rest of your question i hope an md can answer! hope you feel better soon!
329,yes  secondarily a strong exposure to an airborne allergen can cause drainage which when snorting  mouth breathing  throat clearing  then cause throat soreness i have personally had heavy exposure to dust mite (a borrowed pillow) and woke up the next morning with a raw throat
330,musculoskeletal pain most probably musculoskeletal pain however this needs full evaluation with your doctor  if pain persists
331,cannot fairly answer need to know other meds!
332,3 or more the rule of thumb i follow is no more than 3 injections in a one year period into the same area and at least 1 month between injections this may be more or less conservative when compared to other docs but it has kept my complication rate very low corticosteroids over time can weaken or rupture tendons/ ligaments and cause necrosis in bone if your not responding  ask about other treatments
333,need to see doctor only way to find three issues you have is by seeing your doctor you have skin cancer before head lesion could be a skin cancer   'you are weak fatigued  bruise super eaisily ' is also a concern need professional attention and need tests

335,copd? sounds like your cancer is cured  congratulations  you are one of few! you probably smoked and this lingering bronchitis may be uncontrolled copd check with your doctor for bronchodilators +/- steroids radiation pneumonitis would be very unusual after all this time
336,yes in fact  this is fairly common no one knows where spitz nevus leaves off and a melanoma capable of metastasizing begins this is one of the hardest calls in pathology  and some say it's impossible the burning question will be whether to do additional surgery
337,hair before coloring  consult a dermatologist
338,not sure you should not have root canal therapy unless there is a definitive diagnosis and the specific tooth can be identified you may have atypical facial pain and i would suggest seeing someone who specializes or has extensive experience in treating oral-facial pain disorders
339,yes it can the answer is yes it can it can spread to other areas of your body but also  it is possible to be a second primary ( a second melanoma that is not a spread from the 1st melanoma) in any case  you should talk to your md/ dermatologist about this -have it checked and treated -asap
340,barrier methods iud  condoms  diaphragm  spermicide  vasectomy will have little to no systemic side effects
341,depends once a diagnosis has been made  and anticoagulants(blood thinners) have been started and the patient's condition is stable   the md may recommend ambulation (walking) and compression stockings to prevent other clots the stockings are graduated in pressure starting at the ankle the md most familiar with you current condition should be consulted on thigh high or knee high hose
342,several months after starting warfarin the blood clot can no longer grow the body will start to break down the clot within days it takes months to have the clot reabsorbed or for the process to make an opening through the clot so blood can get through again swelling will be visibly less in a few weeks but it could be 6 months before the leg is back to normal occasionally  the swelling persists indefinitely
343,mammogram mammograms are generally better at screening for breast cancer ultrasound is used more for a focus evaluation of an area of the breast that might be suspicious or appear abnormal
344,mulltiple long term effects of radiation therapy for breast cancer include: radiation fibrosis of lung lymphedema of the affected side upper extremity myocardial injury hypothyroidism brachial plexus injury risk of second neoplasm (radiation induced malignancy)
345,about 6 weeks the first week you can expect some discomfort a small percentage of patients have a lot of pain its difficult to determine who they are preoperatively most surgeons want you doing a home exercise program during the 1st week you will be able to walk usually with the use of a cane for a few days at the end of the 1st week  your surgeon will remove sutures and start pt each week you will progressively improve  and usually by 6 weeks you should be 90% healed the last 10% can take several months
346,sounds more like rfx it is common for reflux to increase initially & peak @4-5m it often causes nasal congestion (noise in sleep) & choking most sleep apnea is associated with the acquisition of a significant amount of tonsil & adenoidal tissue babies have little or none while some premi babies often have apnea episodes  even they seldom do after 4m
347,a lot depends on where the break is at if it is not into a joint  there should be little worry about displacement or not  based in the information you gave from two other doctors no surgery now!
348,definitely  no amoxicyline is recommended as an adjunct to surgical management only see a dentist for examination x-rays and treatment dental and gums problems are never any fun  but the good news is that most of them can be easily prevented
349,yes  it ok to finish swollen lymph nodes in your neck and jaw is a symptom of infection it can take a long time for the infection to clear up even after the root canal is completed ask your dentist for more information
350,could be sleep apnea but you need to see a doctor the internet is a great place to answer some questions like what is sleep apnea? or what is cheyne-stokes breathing? the internet not a good place to get a diagnosis that requires obtaining a complete history  a hands-on physical exam  maybe a sleep study or echocardiogram  etc  use the internet to get the questions to bring to your doctor  not the answers
351,possible bakers cyst as well as nerve entrapment see an orthopedist
352,nerve injury no one can tell how long will this last it may be permanent  which is rare (1/10000)  most of the injuries are temporary and may resolve within 1 year
353,because  if a suspicious lesion is noted on mammography an us is obtained this allows for better definition of the lesion in the breast however  a negative us does not rule out an underlying problem and the correct next step is to proceed with your physicians recommendation  in this case a biopsy none of the imaging techniques are perfect  the final decision is based on all the information
354,see your dentist you should see a dentist to check the function of your temporomandibular joint  or jaw joint that is by your ear they can make a better diagnosis and give you treatment options
355,probably it may be related to scar tissue  or maltracking of the kneecap it should continue to improve over time and with physical therapy

360,lyme cns lyme disease can appears similar to that of ms both on imaging and in spinal fluid i recommend lumbar puncture to send for both ms panel and lyme titers some but not all physicians believe in chronicc lyme disease  but this is a different problem than cns lyme affecting the brain/spinal cord
361,mrs mohanty needs to see a doctor there are many reasons why legs can swell the concern is the fact she has pain many people with swollen legs do not complain of pain rather tired legs  a heaviness etc due to t he fact there is pain this should be checked out as you stated the swelling itself appears to have been there a while
362,probably not the general principle is chemotherapy is trying to inflict damage on cells ask your oncologisttherefore probably best to avoid supplements
363,not likely a stenosis of the carotid arteries as in any other artery is a process that takes years to develop and is referred to as plaque plaque that has developed in the artery does not go away on its own it can be removed reliably and safely with endarterectomy of the carotid artery massaging the carotid arteries will likely not help the situation and may dislodge unstable plaque making it dangerous
364,show your derm if your dermatologist did not do a full body check  and you are concerned  let them know
365,a number of processes can cause what is happening to you some are related to infection  some to other issues you should see your doctor hope things are ok

368,allergy to seafood you may have an allergy to seafood avoid seafood in the future talk to your doctor about this allergy testing may be helpful in finding out exactly what is causing the problem
369,choose who you trust ultimately  you must choose the surgeon you trust i'm not sure what a lower degree vs a superior degree we all have one degree - md/do others  like myself  have certification from the american board of surgery and are fellows of the american college of surgeons all indicating that we have passed a number of milestones in training  ethical conduct and continued verification processes
370,scalpel by denitsr the method of draining an abscess depends greatly on the location of the abscess some can not be reached to drain typically  an oral surgeon or a general dentist can drain near surface abscess with a scalpel and place a drain to ensure it drains completely i would not attempt to do it yourself since there are anatomical considerations that make may make that dangerous
371,inner ear issue? inner ear is balance organ  often affected by sinus infection often positional vertigo  nausea  vomiting call your doc
372,a hernia if the swelling disappears when you lie down and massage it  it may be a hernia may require simple surgery if painful if not need to be evaluated by your doctor
373,see your doctor this problem can only be solved by seeing your doctor and being evaluated face-to-face after a thorough examination  your doctor should be able to tell you what's wrong and what to do about it
374,endoscopic or open? it depends if you had the traditional open decompression  then that is normal on average  it takes 3 to 6 months to fully heal if you had it done endoscopically like i do it  with no incision on the hand  then most are fully back to work without restrictions within a few days  and fully healed in a few weeks so in short  it depends mostly on who did your surgery  and how it was done
375,after healing we like to do a post op check up at about 2 weeks after surgery before feeling safe about travel
376,gallbladder dz approximately 30% of gallstones are not visible on ct sludge is better seen on us and gallbladder inflammation can sometimes be better seen on us
377,check there is no way to know without testing similar odors may be caused by bacterial vaginosis and trichomonas generally though trichomonas will cause itching bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance of the vaginal bacteria your excessive hygiene practices may be worsening the problem use of hygiene products such as bubble bath  vaginal spray or vaginal deodorant can increase the risk
378,many possibilities numbness can occur from various reasons some potential causes include vitamin deficiency  nerve damage  nerve compression  and alcohol over consumption  side effects of different medications  or as a result of different systemic medical conditions such as diabetes get evaluated by a professional to determine the diagnosis treatment is based on the diagnosis
379,probably not i am assuming the wisdom tooth cavity is deep if not the wisdom tooth should not be causing any pain from the cavity the two are not related but a person can feel like the pain is coming from the same area a dentist should be able to differentiate the two
380,cranberry concentra cranberry concentrate without sugar or splenda otc product with urinary antiseptic which colors urine orange for 3 to 4 days copious amounts of water
381,yes! absolutely! especially the lower ones see your dentist to determine if this may be the cause of your vertigo

384,74% is normal hida scan with cck augmentation normal range is typically greater than 50%  with 35% to 50% being borderline and less than 35% being abnormal the gallbladder should contract with cck (an analog of a hormone that causes gallbladder emptying) if it is responding/working normally the hida portion examines the liver cells that make bile and the bile ducts to make sure they are not blocked
385,yes! certainly a real possibility i would test again in a few days  or better yetsome folks say that a serum hcg ( blood pregnancy test) is more sensitivetry that ( in my experience  the urine tests we do in my office are usually pretty reliable too) hope this helps dr p
386,see a doctor see a doctor that specializes in head  neck and mouth pain a lot of these symptoms can be explained by tension of the muscles in the neck  temporal area  and jaw muscles this type a doctor can identify and treat the problem areas accordingly
387,absolutely saline irrigation of the nose is safe and effective i encourage all my nasal allergy patients to rinse their nose there are also non=allergic forms of nasal disease as well as chronic sinusitis  where nasal irrigation is crucial
388,no no danger
389,see your doctor this can be as simple as the flu or something much more ominous see your doctor
390,no there are 3 mainstream modalities of breast imaging - mammogram  ultrasound and breast mri each of these has its strengths and weaknesses mammogram is used as a screening tool for all women in the us because it gives the best overall picture the ultrasound is most commonly used to help discern between a cyst and a solid lesion
391,it's possible you could try that route generally speaking  only those who modify their activities  may be able to function fairly well with a torn acl at your age  you should probably have it surgically repaired
392,see your surgeon as an artifical device some clicking can be normal  especially in certain designs new onset of clicking or popping can be a sign of laxity or patella clunk syndrome patella cluck syndrome occurs when scar tissue develops around the patella and gets caught between the patella and femoral components when the knee flexes it is not harmful but can be annoying and removed with surgery
393,no chondromalacia means that the articular cartialge has been damaged most commonly this is involves the patella and is treated nonsurgically with therapy persistent pain may be an indication for surgery there are many procedures for this  including realignment and/or a cartilage restoration procedure  like debridement  drilling  microfracture  osteochondral transplant  or carticel(r) graft
394,depends it would be great if the answer was a definitive yes and  though the way you describe it  it seems likely  but it depends on the type of cancer  the extent of involvement  and the size of metastases also  if there are obscuring findings  like a diffuse pneumonia  it might be difficult to pick up on x-ray
395,push fluids increasing fluids and cranberry may help ideally you should see your pcp or go to an urgent care
396,all all of these can be symptoms of cardiology  and diabetes dramatically increases the risk of cardiology chest pain  shortness of breath  and associated dizziness can all be symptoms of angina  which is caused by narrowing or blockages in the coronary arteries angina might also be accompanied by excessive sweating  nausea  or fatigue cold finger tips may be a symptom of poor circulation to the hands  which can be caused by atherosclerosis in the peripheral arties or also by diabetic nerve disease if you have these symptoms  whether or not you have diabetes  you should definitely see your doctor for further evaluation
397,no  no  breast size generally does not affect the sensitivity of the mammogram breast density on the other hand  can affect the sensitivity of mammography breasts are made up of both fat and glandular tissue if the breasts are mostly fatty  it is easier to detect a small tumor breasts that have a high percentage of glandular tissue and are very dense can easily hide small tumors breast implants can also make mammogram evaluation more difficult; for this reason  additional views are obtained on women who have breast implants (displaced implant views)
398,currently  currently  at our institution we recommend that a woman with no risk factors begin yearly screening mammography at age 40 however  the recommendation for beginning screening mammography has become more controversial due to the recently published recommendations by the us preventative services task force which recommends screening mammography for women age 50 to 74 years a rationale behind this recommendation is that screening mammography in women age 40 - 49 years results in more false positive results with comparatively few cancers detected currently  both the american college of radiology and the american cancer society recommend yearly screening beginning at 40 years of age
399,similiar interstitial lung disease is an umbrella term for many diseases; one of these disease is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or ipf
400,depends every ent doctor has a different answer some let people eat real food right away i tell my patients to avoid foods and drinks that are hot  hard  spicy or acidic for 2 weeks i like my patients to stay away from anything that can scratch  burn or irritate their throats while healing no chips  fries  tomatoes  coffee  tea  lemon orange etc best for you to ask your doctor his/her preference
401,see your doctor if your doctor is treating you for the warts and you've had irritants put on your feet it the past few days  your feet will likely blister and hurt if you're concerned about the look of the reaction  best to go back to your doctor if you have an infection  they'll prescribed you an antibiotic
402,needle biopsy first both doctors are right it is recommended to do a needle biopsy first many times if it is benign additional surgery can be avoided certain benign lesions may require excision to rule out associated malignancy i suspect that was the case of your sister if the needle biopsy showed cancer  then a definitive cancer surgery can be done
403,there there are different types of needle biopsies - depending on the size of the needle used a fine needle aspiration uses a small needle to extract fluid or a few cells while a core needle biopsy actually removes a small piece of tissue the size of the core can vary from very small to about 25 mm in diameter
404,no  symptoms; ↑ds angioplasty: hydraulic expansion of narrowing; damages artery & can easily recur: reason for stents & procedure further complicates the disease process there has long been evidence that arterial disease is at least partially reversible  but mds paid for treating symptoms optimize nmr particle test ldl ?700 nmol/l  large hdl ?9 µmol/l)  hba1c ?60%  50% optimal  sbp ?120  ?body fat  ?activity
405,you you may have already tried not drinking caffeine after noon  not exercising too close to bedtime  and not using your computer or tv within an hour of bedtime consider adding white noise such as a fan be sure that your room is cool and not overly warm eating light during the day  then having a larger meal at around 7 pm or so can be helpful some conditions such as depression can cause early morning awakening  so if you have any symptoms of depression please tell your doctor if your sleep problems are ongoing  you may need a different type of sleep medication at your doctor's recommendation
406,yes large local reactions are a bit more worrisome say u r stung on the ankle  if the swelling goes up to the hip then the person really should see an allergist for testing especially since most people almost never know what stung them it is important  though  to wait 6 weeks after this sting for testing
407,cold or flu cold or flu would be the most likely answer it worsens or continues  see an md good luck
408,while while no physician can evaluate your mole without seeing it  the following clues (the abcde mnemonic) will help you determine if you should see your doctor: asymmetry: if you draw an imaginary line through the middle of your mole  both halves should look about the same moles that are asymmetric (unequal) are more likely to be cancerous border: most benign moles have smooth  distinct borders those that have uneven  hazy  or indistinct borders are more likely to be cancerous color: benign moles usually have a uniform pink  brown  or yellow color those with several shades of brown  black  blue  or red  or those that are jet black or blue-black are more worrisome diameter: most benign moles are smaller in diameter than a standard pencil eraser evolution: any mole that bleeds  changes color or shape  itches  or otherwise causes concern should be evaluated by your physician hope that helps!
409,facelift ; kidney i would think that your history of swelling elsewhere would certainly also apply to your face following facelift surgery it however is not an independent contraindication for surgery - just that it will take a bit longer for recovery
410,should be fine base your activity level on your discomfort level you should be fine if it doesn't bother you at some point however  you should see a general surgeon with experience in both open and laparoscopic hernia repair as we think that hernias are riskier to leave alone in women compared to men
411,er asap go to er immediately  lupus and high bp can cause visual problems both can affect brain function
412,not necessarily a deep plane facelift may be less at risk for sensory changes consult a specialist in facelifting for a detailed consultation wwwasc-psdcom
413,get workup the most concerning is the narrow stools and blood this could be rectal cancer you need a colonoscopy
414,probably the nail is considered dirty if it actually breaks the skin you usually get an infection this can become an abscess if not treated there may also be a spicule present under the skin that you can not see or get to see a podiatrist
415,you and your oncolog you and your oncologist need to discuss this given the low stage  and assuming successful completion of treatment  pet/ct might not be indicated at this time it does depend on the specifics of your case pet/ct is useful in evaluating for distal metastatic disease it does not replace mammography  ultrasound or breast mri for local recurrence surveillance
416,get checked if you have headaches in the mornings or headaches that wake you up from sleep  you should get checked out by a neurologist
417,this this type of swelling occurs in the clear covering over the white part of the eye this clear layer is called the conjunctiva  and it has cells that produce tears  mucous and oils to keep the surface of the eye moist when these cells get over-stimulated  they can over-produce fluids  and this fluid can get trapped between the conjunctiva and the sclera (the white layer)  so a bubble forms usually  this bubble will go away as you get better  but if it is irritating  or if it lasts longer  you should see an ophthalmologist (optometrists are not medical doctors  and most cannot prescribe medications) who can prescribe an anti-allergy drop such as patanol  pataday or bepreve i often find that this is not sufficient  and a short course of steroid eye drops works better these must be used with care  under the guidance of your doctor one last note  please don't press on that bubble  or put anything else in your eye! this can make it more irritated  or cause other problems
418,get evaluated see a sports medicine physician  who will start with xrays an ac sprain can be diagnosed with xray and an exam if it's something else  an mri may be necessary
419,probably if antihistamine up to 4 times the usual daily dose does not help  see a doctor because itching is more miserable than pain and cannot be ignored
420,there there is probably no way for the nurse to be sure of the diagnosis this could be anything from an allergic conjunctivitis to something bacterial if not better in the next 24 hours  i would see an ophthalmologist for diagnosis and treatment
421,arrhythmia mitral valve prolapse is typically asymptomatic by itself but can be associated with some abnormal heart rhythms which can be symptomatic
422,i i agree  as long as you have an otherwise healthy scalp with good circulation and no growths or significant sun damage that would make the grafts not take it is also important to have a good consultation to determine your options  to discuss your goals  and pricing
423,even even though it is very rare (only 19 cases reported as of 2009)  it is possible to have a c difficile infection without a colon i attached the abstract of the paper that describes it below i hope your fiance is feeling better soon!
424,stain of some sort your dentist has given a clean bill of health regarding your teeth i suspect what you are seeing is either a stain or ebernated enamel ebernated enamel is affected enamel  the outer covering of the tooth has had repeated acid attacks from bacteria interspersed with healing periods (possibly fluoride as well) and it heals up they are usually seen between the teeth as opposed to on top
425,typically typically ingrown toe nails cause a localized infection of the skin surrounding the nail (cellulitis) which could eventually lead to an abscess if left untreated what you described sounds more like cellulitis the treatment for this is antibiotics the treatment for an abscess is the same  however in some case it may need to be opened and drained if your primary care doctor is not treating your problem then you should ask for a referral to a podiatrist (foot doctor) you also probably need the ingrown toe nail to be surgically removed best of luck
426,yes no matter what treatment  cancer of the breast does not have 100 % results so with lumpectomy and radiation cancer can still recurr this is why patients need to follow with all their doctors for exams and x-rays if there is a recurrence other options exist such as mastectomy
427,usually not breast cancer that has come back in the lung usually requires chemotherapy it depends on the type of breast cancer  how quickly it is growing  and whether there are multiple spots or just one spot breast cancer in the lung means microscopic cancer has spread through the body  so a whole-body treatment like chemo (or hormone-blocking therapy) is necessary for best results
428,hard to say one white spot on brain mri is nonspecific if it is in a particular area (corpus callosum) it would be more concerning  otherwise it could have been from prior brain infection (encephalitis) or trauma (shearing injury) your symptoms are a bit more worrisome perhaps a spinal fluid analysis will help neurology consult would be useful
429,everyone's everyone's body reacts differently  however most people have significant discomfort/pain for about 2 days  then begin to improve i have seen some patients be quite painful for a week be sure to use the medications as prescribed for pain and you will most likely do well
430,maybe antibiotics help to control a dental infection  but rarely eliminate the source of it a procedure (extraction or root canal) is usually needed to accomplish a cure antibiotics can buy some time  but should not be used on a continuing basis
431,yes impacted 3rd molars very often work their way into the mouth  and many just stay put without a special image called a panoramic or panorex  the dentist has no way of assessing the condition of the roots many times there exist pathologies adjacent to and because of these teeth  with no symptoms at all waiting until you feel pain is too late in my opinion  and would be supervised neglect
432,yes new chemotherapy agents have been introduced there are also newer types of rmachines and techniques however in regards to radiation if you had the same exact problem now versus 13 years ago the treatment might be exactly the same
433,many possible dx there are several possibilities as outlined by the physicians who answered the question in addition  i would add insect bites it would be helpful if you could upload a picture of the rash
434,retreatment vs apico both retreatment and apicoectomy have their place in dentistry i prefer retreatment as a primary next step because it is a more conservative treatment and can be quite successful this is not a discredit to apicoectomy though your case will be unique and should be evaluated by a competent endodontist the use of cbct 3-d imaging will help with the decision-making the os will say extract
435,no the risk to the transplanted lungs are infection from bacteria left over from the old lungs  and acute and chronic rejection of the new lung by the body cystic fibrosis is a defect that is limited to the old lungs
436,varies uncomplicated removal of breast implants may take 15 to 20 min however  if removal of the surrounding breast implant capsule is also performed  surgery may take 1 to 15 hours if the surrounding breast implant capsule has thickened/calcified and/or is symptomatic  patients may benefit from this additional procedure (capsulectomy)
437,see a dentist you have an infection it needs to be treated popping can relieve some of the pressure that you feel but it will not cure the infection please see a dentist and get this treated without treatment things will progress and get worse you may not have so much pain because there can be drainage  but the infection is still there it can effect the rest of your body
438,dr dr wolfe provided excellent information when pressure does not equalize appropriately between the outside of the body and the inside; it can cause squeezes and reverse squeezes bleeding into the ear or into a sinus can actually improve pain as it helps to equilibrate but noone wants to have a pressure - related injury i used to be a diving medicine doctor - so we say lots of these types of problems this is a technique that can be helpful when you are having difficulty equilibrating pressure on airplane ascent or decent place folded paper towels on the bottom of two cups (ie like a sytrofoam cup) poor warm to hot (not boiling) water onto the paper towels hold the cup/ cups over the ear or ears (against your head) that are painful the heat may help to open up your eustacian tubes you can use something like afrin (oxymetazoline) nasal spray to help reduce the swelling however it should not be used more than twice a day for no longer than 3 to 5 days maximum to avoid developing chronic congestion problems i can only use afrin for two days before it becomes ineffective you can also use over the counter decongestants normally  this type of problem with heal with time
439,i i am sure your dentist is legit the question is why are you having so may problems so soon after your treatment has been completed firstly  most teeth that have had root canal therapy are pretty broken down to begin with  so crowns are usually indicated right after the root canal therapy (usually but not always) i don't think your teeth were entirely intact before the crowns were begun (again  tooth needed root canal therapy since it was broken down) you are correct an adequate amount of tooth structure  above the gumline  should remain to help support the post and the crown were posts placed in the teeth in question if not  then the little tooth structure you had left may not have been enough to support the crown as advised by the other panelists  you need an unbiased opinion from someone who can physically examine you best of luck
440,i i recommend that you see a neurologist to find out if you have complex migraine headaches it is important to determine the cause
441,yearly (begin @ 40) mammograms remain our best test to screen for breast cancer most us experts advise starting at 40 (or 10 yrs younger than a close family member who had breast ca) the lump you describe sounds classic for fibrocystic changes: lumpy-bumpy breast tissue that is sensitive to hormonal changes if you find a new lump  it is always best to see your gyne or primary care dr to be extra-cautious
442,drs drs zweig and mcleod have given you good advice sometimes the gum is irritated from the cleaning  sometimes a bit of calculus may have lodged in the space between the gum and tooth  causing an inflammatory response regarding the dentist you are currently seeing the choice is yours you should feel comfortable with the person who is treating you if you were  you wouldn't be asking for our advice you would have called him first best of luck to you
443,lymphedema arm swelling after breast cancer surgery used to be an all-too-common occurrence secondary to the removal of many of the lymph nodes under the armpit  the incidence of lymphedema increases in response to radiation therapy that encompasses this areamodern techniques for lymph node evaluation (sentinel lymph node biopsy) remove far fewer lymph nodes  dramatically reducing the risk of lymphedema
444,yes yes to both since you can't have radiation twice in the same breast  most women need a mastectomy if the cancer returns after breast-sparing surgery you have several reconstruction options after previous radiation  depending on how your breast tissue responded to radiation talk to a plastic surgeon about options
445,if if your stone has not passed by now  and you are still in pain you should see your doctor or present to an urgent care or er if it is after hours you may be dealing with an infectious process as well this needs to be investigated good luck
446,pacifier better but it is likely too late your child always has access to the thumb  and it can do significant harm especially if respiratory patterns and facial growth pattern is genetically problematic pacifier usually smaller and bears less weight than the thumb any sucking habit will tend to narrow the upper jaw and cause front tooth occlusion to be harmed
447,because because this is now impacting your functioning  i recommed that you seek evaluation by a hand surgeon
448,possible neuropathy depending on the affected nerves  symptoms of diabetic neuropathy can range from a numbness and tingling sensation  possibly a burning sensation  to an uncomfortable painful sensation of the extremities neuropathy may affect your digestive system  urinary tract  blood vessels and the heart for some people  the symptoms are mild; for others  it can be painful and disabling
449,knee this is one of those time when acupuncture might help -and won't hurt to try check with family doc for a referral or orthopedist
450,cold only stop the heat and switch to cold packs heat may make you swell  cold will do the opposite you should follow your dentist's instructions that should include warm salt water rinses
451,always always you should be able to contact your dentist if you have any concerns about your treatment or recovery though it sounds as if all is going well the antibiotics generally take 48 - 72 hours to kick in and start making you feel better however  there is a small percentage of cases that do not respond to the particular antibiotics you are using and the infection actually can get dramatically worse very quickly that is why you should contact your dentist if there are questions regarding this
452,cracked cracked teeth are often hard to detect some of the clues that we can use when xrays are normal include: 1 no prior restoration (filling) with pain to biting can suggest a crack/fracture 2 use of a tooth sleuth or bite stick to test different corners of the tooth could detect a weak point 3 a cbct (cone beam ct) can help visualize a fracture 4 pulp testing can determine if a particular tooth is more sensitive to thermal stimuli than other teeth
453,a a neti pot can help to cleanse the sinus/ nasal area however  it will not cure an infection that is in place if there are signs of infection  she should see her physician
454,hello hello you might wish to see a podiatrist if you are diabetic  it is best to have foot care done by a professional a podiatrist can work with the callouses injections is an option however  an adjunct to your care could be medical acupuncture it is performed by do's and md's and can be helpful with a variety of sources of foot pain including neuropathic pain
455,return to sports this timeline is generally 6 to 8 weeks that being said you should consult the orthopedic surgeon who performed the surgery as he or she may alter this normal course based on your intraoperative findings
456,might be tmj there are many things you could have sometimes significant clenching of your teeth can cause muscle spasms the temporalis muscles go along side your head and under your hair try ibuprofen every six hours  try a cold pack along the sore part of your head eat a soft diet  be aware if you might be clenching your teeth if so  see a tmj or bite dentist for help to break the spasms
457,ice cube foot any of the things you are describing should be evaluated by your surgeon sooner rather than later especially since your calf also hurts call right away and head for an er if your surgeon should be unavailable good luck
458,orthotics & exercise sometimes orthotics and cushioned shoes may help-including soft mats on the surfaces you stand on try to keep moving when standing ease into & out of your rest periods stretch your shins and calves during these periods if you are obese-this will contribute and so losing weight would be appropriate orthotics
459,see below herpes simplex is a common virus found in humans there are two main types  referred to as type i and type ii igg stands for immunoglobulin git is an antibody found in the human body igm is immunoglobulin manother antibody it shows up early on in an infection and is used to differentiate certain types of infections
460,great toe pain consider gout  fracture  sprain  ingrown nail  painful hallux valgus (bunion)  infection  tumor(less likely  but possible)
461,you should discuss your concerns with your radiation oncologist not have the radiation will increase the chances the cancer will come back
462,very unlikely while nothing is impossible  the classic symptom of mass effect from a brain tumor is a focal neurologic sign (such as one-sided weakness  or slurred speech) rather than vague headaches and nausea/dizziness the differential for what you are reporting is vast  with brain tumor being a very  very distant cotnender
463,get examined you need a comprehensive work-up to include blood test  stool test  possibly colonoscopy  chest xray  urinalysis etc you could have ibs  pulmonary infection  hormonal imbalance etc go see an internist who may refer you to a gastroenterologist give us a feedback on the final dx
464,quality if you want  you can look for aggressive treatment for her or getting her entered in a study it is her decision i'd urge you to focus at this time on making her last months (or it may be years) matter remember the good times  seek healing if need be  stay involved with her and help her do and enjoy the things that are important to her add life to the time  more than time to the life bless you
465,xanax although dose is low  some sedation can occur
466,perhaps but you should run the decision and discuss dosing with the prescribing doctor first
467,repeat hcg if there has been an ectopic pregnancy  it's important to repeat the hcg tests until the level drops below 5 units
468,may be viral most ear infections  up to 85%  are caused by viruses that won't respond to ab there is also the possibility that his infection is due to a bacteria that's resistant to amoxil when you say he has been on 3d of amoxil are you counting the first day as the day you started the medication? if so then he has only had 2 days worth and it might be that you need to give amox more time good luck
469,speak with your doc you should discuss these concerns with your treating oncologist
470,lymphadenopathy unlikely that this is related to your ear infection lymphnodes typically drain regional anatomy if you had a finger/forearm infection  than it would be plausible
471,sounds like the surgeon was worried enough about that possibility to inform you that mesh could not correct the entire defect at the time of your repair
472,probably not repair of a hydrocele should not cause a problem with sexual performance your surgeon should be able to give a clear idea of the risks and benefits of surgery
473,typically yes if the bleeding you had one year ago was due to colon cancer  you would have had a number of progressive symptoms by now  so i wouldn't worry (plus colon cancer is very uncommon at age 26) if however bleeding recurs or persist have it evaluated
474,see the doctor it would be wise in this case to have him seen by the physician to determine what the illness really is
475,talk to dentist taking probiotics or eating yogurt with active cultures about 2 hours after taking each antibiotic may help to re-populate your digestive tract with good bacteria and reduce heartburn or other stomach distress  etc but talk to your dentist for their exact recommendation  considering your problem
476,nothing special the recovery period is usually unremarkable the first few days the patient may require some soft diet due to discomfort with swallowing liquids should be tepid rather than too hot or cold there may be some visible coating in the beds where tonsills used to be he may need to take some ibuprofen to help reduce the postoperative pain and inflammation
477,healing i am assuming that your decompression is secondary to spinal stenosis because of the multiple levels if this was performed in a nonmiss way  then the pain intensity may be due to the ongoing healing of the muscles  scar tissue and weakness if after 6 months the pain intensity has not decreased then further evaluation by your spine surgeon is warranted
478,not good if you have bone on bone at the knee joint (femorotibial joint) at age 32  it's not good weight loss (unless you're underweight) helps because every 1 lb lost takes 4 lb of pressure off the knee braces may help stability rx and/or cortisone injections or hyaluronic acid injections may make things livable surgery sounds inevitable but you may be able to delay
479,oligometastatic patients with a single brain tumor as the only site of metastatic disease are called oligometastatic  the chance of cure  though small  is real every cancer specialist has a few such patients i would strongly recommend aggressive treatment  including either radiosurgery (cyberknife  gammaknife  etc) to the brain or surgical resection  and again stereotactic or chemoradiation to the lung
480,infection sounds like an oral or jaw infection see oral surgeon asap
481,see a physician you are probably suffering from pharyngitis you should consult a physician to get tested for strep throat sometimes it can be from infectious mono also called the kissing disease your physician can prescribe you antibiotics if it is diagnosed as strep or bacterial pharyngitis
482,see your doctor you need to see your doctor for an examination to evaluate these symptoms
483,need an evaluation i agree with my colleagues suggestions below that you should be seen by an ob/gyn if you have not had sex since your last abortion  this may represent a persistence of a pregnancy or incomplete abortion from 3 mos ago if you have had sex & have conceived again  then you need to discuss your options with a physician (& family  etc) & also consider more effective contraception for the future
484,possible pain is often referred between the ear and the lower teeth  or in this case where they used to be if you have an earache  you may also get pain in your lower jaw if you have a toothache  sometimes it can make your ear hurt your physician can look in your ears and your dentist can check your mouth between the 2 you should be able to find the cause
485,see a breast surgeon i would not recommend a mammogram for a 28 yr old women i advise you to see a breast surgeon (ideally one who performs ultrasound) they can assess the significance of this lump and decide what  if anything  needs to be done in my practice we will see people asap under these circumstances due to the anxiety inherent with this problem
486,umbilical pain pain inside your umbilicus could be a symptom of a small hernia there are some other possibilities okay to check in with your doc an ultrasound of the abdominal wall can be helpful
487,time will tell after stopping depo-provera it can take a while for periods to get back to normal over the next few menstrual cycles you will get a feel for what they are going to be like if they continue to be heavy then see your doctor to discuss your options
488,a good idea the only way that you will know that everything is ok  is to see a dentist just to be sure it is not uncommon for dental problems to temporarily resolve  only to come back with a vengeance the pain that you experienced might have been temporary and require no treatment only a dentist who personally examines you can tell you that for sure better to be safe than sorry  as the saying goes
489,need eval you should get a brain mri with and without contrast to evaluate your brain more detail non contrast head ct is only a very limited test further w/u is absolutely needed go to see your md right away
490,gallbladder  liver yoy are experiencing right sided pain going to the back this could be from the liver  gallbladder  pancreas  and even lung talk to your doctor he/she may to blood work and other tests make sure you write down what makes the pain start  what makes it better or worse
491,see an expert see a tmj expert to help evaluate and treat your problem a tmj expert can be general dentist  an oral surgeon  prosthodontist  orofacial pain specialist ask your physician  dentist or dental society for a recommendation
492,yes it is possible to do the sentinel lymph node prior
493,? one can go with lumpectomy alone if they accept a risk of 3-5% per year of local failure leading to breast loss  and a loss of the survival benefit of raiotherapy however  all cases are not amenable to lumpectomy (size to big  persistent postive margins) there are plenty of good surgeons and radiation oncologists that will work with you
494,yes you are basically describing chronic sinusitis patients with chronic sinusitis typically don't have the nasal discharge that you get with allergies or acute sinusitis but it can lead to chronic nasal stuffiness/congestion/malaise best study for diagnosis: coronal ct of sinuses without contrast - essential for diagnosis
495,likely knee cap the most common and likely cause of pain in front of the knee is an irritated or early wear of the knee cap cartilage or the surface cartilage of the thigh bone that it rubs other causes could include a plica  patellar tendonitis etc for starters avoid knee extension machines  deep knee squats  lunges etc try therapy  antiinflammatories  ice and sometimes a knee sleeve see an orthopedist
496,maybe it might be due to an issue with your teeth or it might be due to the mucsles secondary to some time of extra function (grining and/or clenching) of the teeth
497,ra maybe; lupus no blood tests for ra are negative in up to 30 percent of cases the screening blood test for lupus is negative only rarely
498,possible arthritis the onset and progression of your symptoms suggest that your joints are becoming painful one after the other headaches can occur from arthritis in neck swelling in hands from arthritis can compress the median nerve in hand causing symptoms of ct syndrome
499,psoriasis stay away from any harsh things on the skin topical hydrocortisone may help as well as some sun exposure many times psoriasis will require prescription medications if you have already been diagnosed with it by your doctor
500,it depends the line of the fracture best determines the best film to take if the line of the fracture is not known  then multiple views may be the best way to find the line of fracture to answer your question  a panoramic x-ray may find all the damage or it may not; it depends on the line of fracture
501,abcd's remember your abcd's when thinking of melanoma look for moles with asymmetry boarders that are irregular color differences within the same mole diameter greater than 6mm also any new mole or old that starts to itch  bleed or ulcerate should be of concern another rule is the ugly duckling rule which refers to a mole that looks distantly different from the others on your body
502,not enough info without more information it is difficult to give an opinion you may also have both problems you might consider seeing a specialist in tmj diagnosis see wwwaaoporg or wwwaacfporg
503,check black moles chances are the mole is benign but if it is black and different from your other moles it needs to be checked out skin cancer caught early can be cured with surgical removal do not delay
504,emg nerves cann be damaged by reasons other than injury and back(spine) issues inflammatory  toxic  infectios causes can result in nerve damage if the emg sgows significant nerve damage the task now is to find the cause - its clearly not your spine given the mri
505,see below sound like your not a happy camper but whats your question the bunps on your tongue probably are taste buds but you should see someone for a comprehensive exam
506,yes large tonsils or adenoids are a common cause of sleep apnea in children snoring and gasping for air are signs of sleep apnea you should get your child into their doctor asap and have the tonsils and adenoids checked for removal
507,hematuria blood in the urine can be due to stones  infection (often tuberculosis)  or malignancy this should be thoroughly evaluated and not ignored would see a urologist or nephrologist and follow up with them
508,no if pregnant  the blood test will definitely be positive after 2 weeks is it possible that you could have ovulated later?
509,acl continued instabilty after acl sugery could indicate failure of the original surgery or misplacement of the graft
510,not realted you need to see your physician to clarify why you are doing this
511,immune workup you have certainly tried a variety of medical and surgical treatments for the very frustrating problem of chronic rhino-sinusitis one avenue of evaluation which you may have missed is to check whether your immune system is working properly ask the allergist if this has been evaluated you will need to check whether you make good quality and quantity antibodies
512,creams not effective if you have a dark mole you can not remove it with creams nor should you try the only way to remove a true mole is to excise it completely if your mole has irregular features it should be evaluated by your doctor
513,see a urologist you may have deposits of smug a consult a urologist for help
514,get 3rd opinion pigmented skin lesions are the most troublesome biopsies in pathology the very fact of recurrence would make the original pathologist eager to have the glass slides seen by colleagues your physician can arrange this and don't hesitate to have the lesion re-excised with a fair margin a recurrent pigmented skin lesion probably looks nastier than any scar best wishes
515,what's the cause cellulitis is basically a visible inflammation (itis) of the skin and soft tissues (red  hot  swollen and tender)  it can be caused by many things including sunburn (radiation)  trauma (sprained ankle) or poor vein circulation (stasis dermatitis) it need not be caused by bacteria if you have repeated episodes of this  get to a wound care or vascular specialist  the diagnoses you have is wrong
516,dvt your foot is probably swollen from the trauma of knee surgery  but it can be swollen from a blood clot in your leg  which can be extremely dangerous deep venous thrombus can have formed in one of the deep veins in your leg causing the swelling in your footknee surgery puts you at a very high risk for this it can be very dangerous as this can progress to a pulmonary embolismso get checked out
517,you don't go toer any sudden chest pain due to unknown cause must go to nearest er to make sure it is not an heart attach  save the life   there is no home remedy kit to rule out
518,2 things the white fingers could be raynaud's phenomenon -- the simple treatment is to always keep your hands warm (wear mittens and not gloves in the cold) the lump on your wrist is most likely a ganglion cyst -- it may resolve spontaneously or never really bother you enough to do anything with it you could take meds if your fingers become painful; you could have surgery is your cyst gets in the way
519,see dentist i would suggest seeing a dentist trained in diagnosing and treating the tmj
520,very unlikely if you are asking about the risk after a single head ct scan it is not measureable and is not considered a risk for developing a brain tumor if for some reason you have many routine head ct scans especially if done throughout childhood there is a very small slight increase risk of developing a tumor but far less than 5% the low dose of radiation from modern ct scans is negligible if used safe
521,no a simple cyst is benign
522,often not but our design is protective here the forehead in toddlers is thicker than other parts of the skull and if he shows no signs of altered behavior nor illness it is probably ok make his brother stop roughing him up
523,maybe i would definitely have him evaluated he could have a bacteria that is resistant to the amoxicillin it is also possible that there is another source for the fever
524,needs biopsy an enlarging or changing mole should be addressed by excisional biopsy see your dermatologist or plastic surgeon to have it addressed the obvious concern is a change or dysplasia in a mole which can lead to melanoma
525,follow up with the doctor who performed the procedure sometimes  there may be a piece of nail that was not removed  other times a cyst may of developed where the procedure was performed
526,not likely try taking a bulk laxative like metamucil  a couple of table spoonfuls each day for a couple of weeks to see if the symptoms resolve if that does not help  it would be time to see a doctor
527,no exposure is exposure the only way to worsen it would be to move from anal to vaginal sex without properly cleaning
528,lumps are not always even no cancerous  benign lumps can grow if not already done  you should have a clinical evaluation and an ultrasound don't assume this is cancer if the mass is solid it should be biopsies - preferred method: core biopsy
529,most likely normal agree with the other answer want to add that the most common after effects of a minor head injury  or concussion  are: headache  mild dizziness  and sometimes mild confusion these almost always get better with time
530,gain muscle mass a single 5 g (5000 mg) oral dose in healthy adults results in a peak plasma creatine level of approximately 120 mg/l at 1–2 hours post-ingestion creatine has a fairly short elimination half-life  averaging just less than 3 hours  so to maintain an elevated plasma level it would be necessary to take small oral doses every 3–6 hours throughout the day follow directions!
531,optic nerve oct there is a disease called benign intra-cranial hypertension (bih) or previously known as pseudo-tumor cerebri oct is an ocular ct scan that many ophthalmologists have often bih is misdiagnosed as migraine if your oct showed optic nerve swelling (elevation) and nasal decrease of optic nerve fibers you need to have a spinal tap by your neurologist to rule this easily treated condition out
532,unlikely it is unlikely that a tumor has developed in 4 mths there are many causes of headaches like sinus problems  migraines  temporal arteritis   tmj issues  high blood pressure etc you need to see your family doc or a neurologist to get evaluated and treated
533,yes a headache is one of the expected side effects of starting on zoloft you can take aspirin or ibuprofen or whatever you would usually do to help it it should improve over the next 8 days  but may come back briefly if your doctor increases your dose
534,no lies surgical training is accomplished mostly by trainees gradually performing more and more of an operation under the direct supervision of the attending surgeon in the us  make no mistake that the surgeon is primarily responsible for every aspect of your operation  and takes that responsibility very seriously while there are exceptions to every rule  you are getting who they say you're getting
535,dense breasts do decrease the sensitivity of mammo for detecting cancer  but screening mammo is still the standard of care for dense breasts dense breasts are also a risk factor for the development of cancer the amount of radiation from a mammo is minimal  you are 250 times more likely to die in a car accident than get a radiation induced cancer the benefits of early detection outweigh the slight rad risk
536,here are some… i'm glad to see you have received such wonderful medical care; however  based on currently available information  it would be most logical to direct your current concern & question to the treating doctor for confirmation & counseling so to minimize potential confusion and anxiety  which commonly results from online inquiry of course  make sure to supply detailed hx stressing sequence of events
537,maybe mri i can't examine you but   do you play any sports ? to you jump alot ? the little bump/bone of the top of your shin is your tibia tubercle and becomes swollen/irratated from this type of movement
538,no if its a pimple a pimple is not an std there are some infections that one might confuse with a pimple so getting an exam is your next step genital warts  herpes  syphilis and moluscum could be confused with a pimple
539,probably not but if you are passing gas and having bowel movements that is reassuring but in anyone with recent surgery who finds themselves suddenly having worsening abdominal pain it would be prudent to see their primary care provider or general surgeon who did the surgery if the pain worsens or persists

707,unstable vitals those are considered unstable vital signs call your doctor or get to one asap

716,calluses corns/calluses form from friction against the skin  but also moisture is needed on top of changing shoes and socks  try moisture control by using spray deodorant on your feet this helps decrease moisture also file them down daily in the shower or use vicks vapor rub to soften them up lastly  off-load the areas to take pressure off and prevent reformation hope this helps! good lucks!
717,only a small subset i watched the video and it's a hybrid procedure between a microfracture surgery and a modified osteochondral autograft procedure both of these procedures have guarded results and are reserved for acute cartilage injuries  not for fulminant arthritis with changes in mechanical alignment unfortunately  for your age group  there are very few individuals that would benefit from this procedure
718,probably i'm assuming you're talking about bovine colostrum any medication or supplement can cause temporary hair loss (technical name: telogen effluvium)  and it nearly always grows back; but you'll have to give it some time insulin-like growth factors (igf) are probably not the mediators in such situations  but no one knows for sure biotin (a b vitamin) 5000 units/day may help to speed up regrowth
719,could be either there is a lot of overlap between premenstrual symptoms and early pregnancy symptoms even light bleeding around the time of an expected period can occur with pregnancy a home pregnancy test and/or a blood test at your doctor's office may help clear things up after testing  if you are pregnant or still have unexplained symptoms consult your doctor

724,rest  ice & elevate! some swelling after surgery is normal the amount and location may not be the type of surgery is important  but post-op care is a very big factor simple ice and elevation with range of motion exercises when called for can prevent or reduce swelling sometimes rest alone with elevation of the feet to eye level for several days will do it joint surgery usually requires motion to heal properly
725,root canal most endodontists ( root canal specialists) complete root canals in one visit sometimes complications will require a second visit at this point you should have the tooth re-evaluated by an endodontist
726,melanoma yes melanoma has a genetic component all direct relatives should be aware of watching for skin changes that could predict cancer
727,yes  can happen some supplements can cause flushing  which could well feel like a hot flash  and niacin is a common offender several meds are listed also as causing flushing  such as the new ms drug tecfidera the physicians desk reference will be an all-inclusive source to assist your search and confirm or disconfirm possibilities also  discuss with your doctors

731,no & maybe hcg should only be present in someone who is pregnant +hcg weeks before menses could indicate an early pregnancy  there are also uncommon tumors of the ovary that can cause +hcg levels in patient who are not pregnant (a couple of other very rare conditions can cause also) and  lastly  people who use hcg administration for weight loss will have + levels in their system
732,why take risks??? mrsa aside  why are you sleeping with a child cosleeping with infants is associated with suffication deaths (see aap position statement pediatrics 11/11) by mid childhood this fosters dependence at a time when kids should begin to create their own individuality & accomplishments
733,also consider lice! in my area it is an epidemic among grade school aged children if you're around any children  it might be worth combing through your hair with a lice comb to see if any of the little buggers are there if so treat for lice and you're cured! andlice prefer clean hair to dirty hair so this suggestion is no judgment on you!

736,i would not be surprised if you have sleep apnea get it checked out

740,ulnar nerve the ulnar nerve is succeptable to trauma at the elbow as it passes around a groove on the medial side called the cubital tunnel avoiding excessive elbow flexion and cushioned elbow protector can help anti-inflammatory meds or pain meds like neurontin may also help evaluation by a nerve specialist like a neurosurgeon is warranted if there is progressive numbness in the fingers or hand weakness
741,no you're more likely to be hit my a meteorite than to have stomach cancer it's something else  and probably nothing bad relax if it gets worse  get it checked out
742,slight chance of the palpable lesions of parotid  about 80% are benign and 20% malignant rate of transformation in the latter group not well defined but if it occurs   bx of tumor mass difficult to obtain in terms of adequate sampling as such most are surgically resected for dx unless palpable nodes present major operation is defining landmarks of the nerve at stylomastoid foramen
743,depends most cases of stress urinary incontinence (sui) are the result of pelvic relaxation due to vaginal deliveries for many women  kegel exercises can decrease the symptoms of sui if your incontinence is affecting your daily activities  you should see a gynecologist or a urologist for diagnostic testing and discussion of treatment options

745,i agree with the other doctors comments i would add though that the peak of swelling is usually 72 hours post surgery  so your tennis ball may even get larger once swelling presents  it is difficult to modify this ice for the first 48 hours & then on third day moist heat application to help reduce swelling a tennis ball size swelling is a bit excessive though motrin 800mg  & narcotic for pain - & time
746,unlikely dvt cases are multifactorial  usually because of stasis of blood in the legs( e g bed ridden patients)  hypercoagulable disorders (eg cancer patient or hereditary disease  oral contraceptive pills) or injury to the deep venous system unless your tight jeans are resticting flow of blood from your legs( cannot walk   swollen legs ) then they would not be a causative factor
747,second opinion symetrical (both sides) swelling/inflammation of joints is often a sign of an underlying auto-immune disease ra is one of many there are conditions that have no test for (as of yet) and they are called seronegative arthritis ( ie tests are negative ) they can be treated with the same medications as ra but it is a clinical judgement based on the doctor's analysis and the severity of complaints

758,depends this condition is unrelated to your breast cancer history ask your doctor what concerns or not are registered by the radiologists some type of thyroid calcifications are more likely to be benign 6mm thyroid nodule is small & need to know risks of trying biopsy near carotid artery too the doctor who ordered the study would know much more to help you than is able to be reported here
759,probably-no warranty in all likelihood  you will be able to nurse however it is possible that significant ductal damage may be incurred  that nursing may be difficult or impossible if this is a major concern  you should either avoid implants until after completion of pregnancies or consider breast crease or armpit incisions remember that even without implants nursing may not be possible

778,not really if it is happening while asleep   i do not know how you feel those experiences  in any case if this is not happening all the time particularly while awake   it is most likely some benign process  even if it is happening all the time it is sign of what we call peripheral neuropathy which is caused by multiple condition  diabetes is by far the most common cause
779,false:talk to ur doc pelvic surgery  whether total or partial hysterectomy  vaginal or abdominal  w/ or w/o oophorectomy  does not render you asexual sure you might have some initial post-op discomfort and if ovaries are taken  you may (not) need menopausal hormone therapy (new catchphrase) but once recovered  you can be as sexually active as you once were be sure to ask your gyn about any & all questions pre-op
780,see a neurologist if the headaches are severe and episodic  you could be having migraines this in particular  if there are visual symptoms such as flashing like or if there is sensitivity to light a neurologist should be able to help to diagnosis and treat this you may also need additional brain imaging studies like an mri scan depending on what the neurologist finds on your physical exam and history
781,skin lesion i would recommend you have a dermatologist examine this mole
782,can't tell it is too early to say from your info  it appears that you are/were being treated for a breast abscess the antibiotics resolved the fever  but the abscess mass may persist and need surgical drainage even if it is abscess

803,too dangerous? it's likely several factors  some of which may not be evident procedures all come with risks and benefits-it may just be that the abscess is in a location that may affect delicate nerves or it's too large to do it without anaesthesia alternatively  your dentist may not be qualified to perform the procedure; it may be a job of an oromaxillofacial surgeon (omfs)

823,it would vary depending on the extent of the infection typically after the extraction and thorough debridement of the socket  one would like to wait 4-6 weeks before re-entry to do the bone graft or place the implant or both your treating dentist would make the best recommendation based on your situation hope this helps
824,yes! it is important to keep bacteria out of the access hole and a temporary restoration will help also  it is important to have a permanent restoration to prevent bacteria from seeping into the tooth and causing further decay of the remaining tooth structure this should be done within a month or two after having the root canal completed

1237,recurrent problem the collapsed lung is called a spontaneous pneumothorax if it happens without prior trauma if he has anatomical blebs in his lung or his doctors feel he is at high risk for recurrence they may do a bleb resection and/or a pleurodesis which is deliberate scarring to force the lung to adhere to the chest wall so it can't collapse again as is prone to happen in some people
1238,mouth breathing it is not uncommon with osa that an individual may have nasal airway insufficiency and thus breathe primary through their mouth this dysfunctional breathing pattern may lead to an enlarged tongue and at night during sleep  nocturnal bruxism continues except rather grinding and clenching on the teeth  the enlarged tongue takes the brunt of the damage
1239,not to worry breast pain may be a sign of cancer  however  breast pain is far more commonly due to benign processes cyclic changes in hormone levels are a common cause of breast pain if this persists beyond a few cycles  i suggest you see your gyne for a breast exam having a 60 yr old g'mother w/breast cancer should not change your risks & at age 20 your chance of cancer is 1in a million

1241,possible bakers cyst as well as nerve entrapment see an orthopedist
1242,because  if a suspicious lesion is noted on mammography an us is obtained this allows for better definition of the lesion in the breast however  a negative us does not rule out an underlying problem and the correct next step is to proceed with your physicians recommendation  in this case a biopsy none of the imaging techniques are perfect  the final decision is based on all the information
1243,yes possibly popping or clicking of the joint is very difficult to eliminate  even with surgery if you have no pain and no locking (limited opening or trouble closing  ) then you may have to live with the popping conservative treatment can help diminish or cut down the popping  but you should seek out a tmj/tmd specialist
1244,biopsy most of the cold nodules on thyroid scans are benign but cancer has to be ruled out thyroid biopsy is a relatively noninvasive and simple procedure to perform and can give the answer i would definitely suggest to start with a biopsy as an initial step then   if it is inconclusive or you feel very uncomfortable  talk to your physician good luck

1248,possibly mri and chest x-rays are not 100% sensitive it's possible that the mri could have missed cancer if your symptoms are not resolving in spite of medical therapy  then you should look into getting re-evaluated i think cancer would be low on the list at your age  but certainly not unheard of the pain is telling you something  so be sure to get a solid diagnosis
1249,bad headache the answer would depend largely on how long have you had this type of headache if this is a pattern you have had for many years  then the chances of some type oof pathology are low if it is a very recent onset  then it should be investigated by a qulified headache specialist
1250,ask them if there is a focal lesion which can be followed or removed you need the highest quality imaging sedation 32 channel 3t head coil is needed if your hospital does not have this - ask your surgeon if they know of a place that has this this gives you the best chance to find a seizure focus just for instance i found a seizure focus in a patient missed by two prior scans so ask for it
1251,yes without premedication  swelling can be common with anti-inflammatory and anti-swelling perscription pre medications  these unpleasant effects of wisdom teeth removal can be managed quite comfortably discuss this with your treating dentist
1252,viral this could be viral infection  i e ebv  flu  cmv  adenovirus  rhinovirus or assoicated secondary bacterial infection need to see your doctor and needs testing and appropriate testing

1257,you should visit a doctor and have it checked out at minimum  you likely should be wearing an ankle brace if you injure the ankle and it is unstable and you continue to walk on it you are not allowing it to heal properly
1258,get checked out depending on where you live  where you've traveled and a variety of other factors that you haven't mentioned  the best advice is to seek the advice of a local health care provider if you live in the us and based on your age  the most likely problem is an infection (bronchitis or pneumonia) you'll want to get this checked out soonest
1259,probably not once dental decay breaks down tooth structure it is considered irreversible it is necessary to restore the tooth to its normal shape and size with a filling otherwise the cavitation or hole will become a food trap and will increase in size

1265,probably not most likely it is plantar fasciitis stress fractures in the heel can occur  but they usually heal within 6-10 weeks an x ray will be able to tell for sure
1266,see a doctor see a doctor that specializes in head  neck and mouth pain a lot of these symptoms can be explained by tension of the muscles in the neck  temporal area  and jaw muscles this type a doctor can identify and treat the problem areas accordingly
1267,unlikely your symptoms are too nonspecific for ms  and suggests a very different etiology my first thought is to evaluate for tarsal tunnel syndrome or a peripheral neuropathy of small fibre type
1268,several many general dentists are well trained and qualified and routinely remove wisdom teeth in their practices oral surgeons have advanced training and often treat the more complicated or difficult cases and may be better equipped to handle complications that may occur although some general dentists may offer iv sedation  most oral surgeons offer iv sedation or general anesthesia routinely
1269,anxiety your description sounds like you have some eye irritation from dry eye causing your headaches and pain the left cheek tingling is likely a manifestation of your anxiety i would try artificial tears during the day  ointment at night  warm compresses  and omega-3 fatty acid supplements if no improvement  see an eye doctor for further treatment
1270,need follow-up soon! not sure how long these symptoms have been present  but this requires attention soon - you may have an infection that will not resolve on its own  and the swelling could be problematic by itself seek medical help for this right away

1274,see below it's likely that the antibiotic altered the bacetrial flora causing the odor

1282,depends this really depends on how high your blood pressure is  how well it is controlled and what other medical problems that you have i recommend seeing a board certified plastic surgeon who could discuss this issue with you and help you determine the best course of treatment for you
1283,yes those symptoms could all reflect a colon cancer  and that is what needs to be ruled out by a physician it could possilby be other causes  diverticular disease  ibs  malabsorption syndromes  but the most worrisome possible cause (colon cancer) still remains pretty high on the list of possibilities seek medical attention please!
1284,save your money see a dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon injecting vitamins will be a waste of time & money homeopathy is strictly placebo only for tv you need only makeup don't believe the hype a few blemishes are never ugly major scars can be improved with cosmetic proceedures if it sounds too good to be true  it is not true

1289,if if you are young it will be simple your surgeon only needs to remove enough bone to get the tooth out that's what i call a window the bone will heal back uneventfully you will not be in the pain you are imagining but the first week after surgery you will be sore and eating will take more effort after the second week you can get back to eating that beef jerky so don't fret it will go well

1291,no 10 to 15 percent of breast cancers can not be seen on mammograms even if a mass or other finding is physically identified for that reason women are told to examine themselves monthly and see their doctor for an exam yearly or more if they have prior history of breast cancer that was treated
1292,yes in small cancers with no spread standard radiation and radiosurgery can cure lung cancer but the standard of care is surgery in more advanced cancer radiation can cure but is more effective with chemotherapy i am referring to nonsmall cell types of lung cancer
1293,perio endo lesion there could be two different things going on with your crown dull ache and radiating nerve pain indicates that the nerve in your tooth is diseases and you should be evaluated for root canal it also sounds like your dentist is concerned about a gum  periodontal problem in this area also perio-endo lesions can occur together and need to be treated together
1294,hard to say one white spot on brain mri is nonspecific if it is in a particular area (corpus callosum) it would be more concerning  otherwise it could have been from prior brain infection (encephalitis) or trauma (shearing injury) your symptoms are a bit more worrisome perhaps a spinal fluid analysis will help neurology consult would be useful
1295,yes it improves survival significantly in stage 1-3 lung cancers cyberknife provides survival similar to surgery in stage 1 patients for stage 2-3 patients  both chemo and radiation may be used to improve survival in certain patients with stage 4 cancer (such as with spread to the brain) radiation may help improve survival
1296,symptoms symptoms of middle ear fluid can include dizziness  nausea  or vomiting  headache  plugged ears  trouble hearing and ringing in your ears if there is a middle ear infection you could also have a fever and feel weak

1299,possibly radiation can injure the lung tissue therefore since copd is already an injury they can be additive the radiation doctor needs to know values for fvc and fev1 (tell you how good the lung is) and consider these in his planning for the radiation the majority of lung cancer is in smokers and most have copd so its just how bad it is and how much lung is going to be radiated
1300,prevention is best if you are beginning to have some signs and symptoms it is best to see about early treatment as the results are quicker  better and less damage can occur check with your dentist as it sounds like you are in the early stages of development  which may be reversible with proper diagnosis and / or treatment
1301,absolutely lymph nodes should be checked by a doctor and not on the internet
1302,your your physician and surgeon should have reviewed the pros and cons of a cholecystectomy now versus waiting for worsening symptoms there is always a possibility of another source  but when a well known cause of upper abdominal pain is identified  additional work up is unlikely to identify a reason not to remove the gallbladder removal of the gallbladder poses the least amount of risk when it is not inflamed (cholecystitis) and if the stones are small  there is an ongoing risk of pancreatitis as long as the gallbladder and stones remain a full history  physical exam  and studies have been performed by your physician; i recommend following your surgeon's advice or seeking another opinion a laparoscopic cholecystectomy is easier to recover from than an open procedure or pancreatitis don j peterson  md facebookcom/donpetersonmd
1303,biopsy i agree a nodule this big should be biopsied chance of malignancy is low but you need to do it to find out
1304,my my you are familiar with the terminology! congratulations  are you in the medical field? now then  clearly with a pain on biting something is wrong with the tooth or the bone supporting it an endodontist teat root canal problems  and your general dentist will repair and rebuild a tooth that has been root treated these two work as a team i recommend that you go and see you regular dentist and explain the problem  get some x-rays and pressure testing done on the teeth  and remember to ask to include testing for root fractures the fact that the muscles produce the pain when you move them is a clear sign that there is some kind of pressure being placed by them on a tender area when they contract it is time to get the problem checked good luck  dr neil mcleod dentistry that lasts - quality that counts
1305,without without examining you  it is hard to say for sure what you have you could be having an initial infection of herpes causing your symptoms  or you may have another viral illness such as coxsackie virus (hand  foot and mouth illness often seen in little kids) or herpangina (sore throat due to ulcers) to know for certain  you should give your doctor a call and have them take a look if your fever persists above 104f  fever remains for more than 5 days  if your vomiting worsens  if you think you are dehydrated  or if you feel sicker after 3-4 days instead of better you should see your doctor good luck!
1306,as as david stated prior you may have a blockage or stone in the duct you should see an ent or oral surgeon who can handle the problem correctly you should definitely get x-rays or a ct done to determine what is going on if you have a stone many times it can be removed without a problem but if this is a chronic issue or has a stone rather large then the gland may need to be removed it is hard to treat over the web and only having a specialist who does these procedure examine you and gives you a proper diagnosis will be able to help you out good luck!
1307,? molluscum there are many possibilities  but one that fits your description might be molluscum contagiosum this is a viral infection of the skin you should see a health professional for further evaluation
1308,i i assume that you are referring to amalgam or silver fillings as regular fillings  and dental bonding as bonded composite fillings either one replaces the lost tooth structure destroyed by cavities amalgam fillings look unesthetic  conduct hot and cold more to the nerves of the teeth  and therefore often cause more sensitivity when drinking or eating very hot and cold liquids or food bonded composite fillings sometimes wear more than amalgam fillings  but look more esthetic  often appear invisible and actually bond to tooth structure  thereby making them stronger  rather than weaker once filled generally speaking  i would much prefer to have bonded composite fillings in my own mouth as there are many more advantages to them you and other readers should be aware that they are usally more costly and many insurance companies will not pay for the additional cost on posterior (or back) teeth  which is unfortunate
1309,as as dr fleming stated  you would be better off having any surgery to your upper and lower jaws first  then the rhinoplasty are you sure you need jaw surgery? have you consulted with an oral surgeon? an orthodontist? it appears you may need a team to work with you to get things just right consult with them first hope this info helps
1310,symptoms = surgery symptomatic gallstones are an indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy not an emergency but don't wait forever

1312,you you should go back to see your dentist the proper name for a temporary crown is a provisional restoration it is meant to test your tooth  gums  and environment prior to the final crown unless surgery was done  this should feel totally normal please call your dentist and inform him or her about the symptoms if the pain persists  you might have problems with the final work as well best of luck  dr zev kaufman
1313,yes the glands are lymph nodes which are part of your body's defense mechanism when fighting off infection  they may swell up and become tender the location of the sores you mention and the swelling of the glands leads me to suspect that you might be having an episode of herpes in conjunction with the aphthous ulcers you might want to see your dentist or family md for an evaluation feel better
1314,certain certain local anesthetics can have a duration of action of 6 to 8 hours depending on the site of injection these long acting anesthetics are routinely used in third molar surgery to provide extended relief from surgical pain if the anesthesia remains the morning after the surgery it may indicate that the nerve in the area may have been disturbed this is a known consequence associated with the removal of the lower third molars and can result from stretching  compressing or tearing of the nerve stretching and compression injuries have better prognosis for recovery  though it may take several months for full sensation to return thought injuries typically do not require further treatment  just monitoring injuries that involve transection of the nerve can be permanent it is these types of injuries that may require further surgical treatment no matter the cause  prolonged anesthesia  greater than a day  require follow-up by the treating surgeon
1315,can't can't tell if you are infected  but from your description it sounds like you have an open cantact in that area the open contact can be caused by teeth shat have shifted  a loose or defective filling  or a cavity the food you are eating is getting impacted between the teeth  irritating the gum tissue  and causing it to swell a bit probably bleeding and sore due to the pressure floss and brush to clean it out  then a little salt water and/or mouthwash brushed into the area to help reduce bacterial count see your dentist to have it corrected  since left untreated it can not only be annoying  but the inflammation can result in localized bone loss and periodontal pocketing also  take otc analgesics to relieve pain and reduce inflammation
1316,are are we sure this is a lymph node? an isolated lymph node in the suboccipital area would be unusual unless there were inflammatory/infectious processes of the posterior scalp skin or very rarely spread of skin cancers did it appear at the time of your other symptoms or has it possibly been present for some time and you now just noticed it sebaceous cysts (blocked oil glands) or small lipomas (fatty tumors-benign) can be mistaken for a lymph node if it persists beyond 3-4 weeks it would be reasonable to have it looked at if it remains swollen and tender (not usually a characteristic of a malignant lymph node) a course of appropriate antiobiotics and short term oral steroids wouldn't be inappropriate
1317,forget the nurses for a second  you need to follow up with the doc and get a follow up x-ray there are two issues here - the break  and the possibility the sore created a new problem such as a possible deeper infection you did not state how you broke the foot or if you have comorbidities like diabetesfollow up with a doc

1324,gingival tattoo sometimes in the process of doing a silver amalgam filling  small pieces of the excess filling can become embedded in the gum tissue  creating what your describing the area is not swollen  but is purplish and is close to the filling it is not dangerous  but if you find it effects your esthetics see a periodontists
1325,this this is commonly called temporomandibular joint disorder  or tmd (some say tmj  but that just describes the joint  and not the problem) sometimes the disc that the joint uses gets out of alignment and it can be painful to move the jaw try 800 mg ibuprofen 3 times per day for 3 days if that doesn't do the trick  see your dentist if they have tmd experience  they can help  and if not  they should be able to give an appropriate referral you may need oral appliance therapy

1453,not likely lymph nodes in the neck enlarge for lots of reasons often it's infection  sometimes immunizations if they're small (< 1/2) they may just be scarred from a previous infection cancer may grow slowly   but typically if they were cancerous nodes they would have clearly enlarged over 5 months with no treatment

1548,see below get rechecked for worsening of the asthma or development of a pneumonia
1549,vascular the cold sounds like an impingement of the circulation   but an exam by a podiatrist is indicated
1550,my thoughts do you really have diagnostically proven ms or is this merely a possible concern? yes  lesions on mri films do indeed change  but never disappear  and over time increase in size and quantity if effective medication is not employed would encourage a visit to a neurologist to get all of this clarified
1551,unlikely ms you probably possess a peripheral neuropathy secondary to either diabetes or other causes this needs an assessment from a neurologist  who is experienced in the varying types of peripheral nerve disorders
1552,yes  valuable tool at this time the 1 5 tesla mri is the most commonly used image to assess and evaluate ms the 30 tesla may pickup more lesions  but does not provide significantly better clinical diagnostic accuracy
1553,unusual normally when we see red lower legs its associated with pain from cellulitis or circulation  may be allergic reaction to something see your doctor
1554,wisdom tooth the answer you are probably expecting is to see yor dentist or an oral surgeon and schedule to have wisdom teeth removed based on your description you should probably be on antibiotics as soon as possible you will feel much better once the teeth are removed and this will no longer be something you have to worry about
1555,depends depends on the knee surgery and how your knee is feeling
1556,yes  it can of course over-studying and under-sleeping can lead to headache  nervousness  and dizziness anxiety makes the sleeplessness worse  and vice versa you also need to make sure not to use stimulants (caffeine  amphetamines  etc) because they will worsen your state establish regular sleep/wake times even on weekends exercise  even just a walk around the block see doctor if symptoms persist

1559,depends it is possible to have normal tsh levels  and it is also possible to have abnormal tsh levels benign nodules may or may not change in size anytime there is a change in nodule size (especially a rapid growth) anywhere on the body  it's good to have it reevaluated by a doctor
1560,mammogramssavelives your answer is right here--do the math the radiation exposure of a digital mammogram is 37mgy this is associated with a lifetime-attributable risk of breast cancer of 13 cases per 100  000 the lifetime incidence of breast cancer in us women is 1:8 mammography is a safe  proven technique for finding cancers well before they are palpable and there is no controversy about its use after age 50
1561,polyclonal polyclonal gammopathy are usually related to chronic inflammation  chronic diseases  autoimmune disorders etc - and usually not due to blood malignancy
1562,possibly if the pain is in the area where your wisdom teeth are erupting  then it is probably due to the inflammation
1563,you need to work up to the max dose over time as you probably know lyrica is another option see a pain specialist if you can't get relief  they may suggest a spinal stimulator trail
1564,therapy you can try ibuprofen over the counter and physical therapy as a first line treatment of a herniated disk without surgery if you fail therapy and your pain persists  you may need surgery try to do physical therapy first williams and mckenzie exercises help quite a bit
1565,sounds like it sounds like ringworm if it is raised on the edges and has central clearing  it probably is this is caused by a dermatophyte and can be treated with anti-fungal cream
1566,good idea do the trial then implant i if it works  has out performed revision surgery in studies no reason to think a fifth surgery would be helpful burning pain could be permanent nerve damage with no structural solution blocking the transmission of afferent impulses makes sense to me
1567,soooo nodule is not a diagnosis it is a description of a finding on a study really need to know what kind of nodule there are several types of nodules that are completely benign he would not have told you all was well unless i really was doctors are generally very conservative if her doc said not to worry why do you continue to worry? maybe you should talk to them again
1568,neurology i would stick with the neurologist
1569,asthma these are common symptoms in asthma exacerbations of all degrees and should prompt you to seek medical attention
1570,no get help this behavior is only going to lead you down a darker road all of these substances mess up your neurotransmitters the first thing you need to do is to seek professional help to get detoxed ie get your brain dried out oce what we call a baseline is established what other steps are needed can be determined you need d&a therapy & individual & if appropriate family &conjoint [preferred other]
1571,recurrent tmj/tmd is very common tmd is the second most frequent cause of orofacial pain after dental pain it can be divided into disorders related to the muscles of mastication and those emanating from the tmj earache and head pressure are common symptoms due to the close location to tmj rec: orofacial pain practitioner for diagnosis
1572,add w/reduction this could be anterior disc displacement with reduction  a temporomandibular joint disorder your eustacion tube is directly behind this joint and extreme pressure from the joint can cause abnormal hearing  usually it is more of a stuffy feeling in your ear canal i would not consider this permanent  unless you never addressed the tmjd
1573,high risk evaluation i recommend you seek out a high risk breast program or specialist to do an extensive family history to determine when and what type of screening is indicated
1574,multiple symptoms based upon your symptoms you should be seen by a periodontist  general dentist  orthopedic surgeon and a primary care physician or ent start with your worst symptom and see the appropriate doctor
1575,u should be seen asthmatics should have two medications 1- the brown one  (most likely qvar he should be doing it twice a day always  to help eliminate exacerbations 2- the blue one is for when he is sick and to help open up his lungs 3- if he is having trouble he needs to be seen immediately  he may need oral steroids he is either not doing the med right or not enough
1576,possibilities: while i rarely take iliac crest bone graft because it usually isn't necessary  when i do  my patients never complain of pain from the graft site it definitely could be si joint pain  you should have your si joint evaluated with the 5 provocative tests for si instability if at least 3 are positive  then an si joint injection  radioablation  or minimally invasive fusion may alleviate your pain
1577,not likely the scope is sterilized between patients so transmission is unlikely colonoscopy is fairly safe and great screening tool for colon cancer
1578,it should you had a lot of work completed in a small  confined space not unusual for the tissue to be sore and feel tight as the healing process begins
1579,depression there are a lot of antidepressants that are not addictive i would recommend seeing a doctor about the depression although not addictive  there are some that you should not just stop taking  all at once
1580,allergic rhinitis this time of year it looks like you are allergic to trees and/or grasses which are giving you symptoms of an allergic nose the runny nose is giving you a post nasal drip which is irritating and making you cough
1581,calf pain is the calf hot  red  swollen? you may have a venous blood clot or an infection of the skin both should be checked out at once for proper diagnosis & treatment
1582,see md may need biopsy to find out what it is
1583,absolutely you have endocarditis and need to be seen and treated by infectious diseases experts asap echocardiography  even if done at its best  does not exclude the diagnosis and you have most of the criteria there are many cases of culture-negative endocarditis if you are not being seen by an id expert you need to do that now there are serologic studies to identify organisms (like coxiella burnetti)
1584,contact surgeon numbness after this type of procedure is a rare complication  but it happens nonetheless have you discussed this with your surgeon? if not  now is the time to call
1585,foot pain try resting it (for 1-2 weeks)  icing  compressing wraps or bracing  and elevating your rolled ankle take otc antiinflammatory drugs like advil or motrin as directed by the manufacturer to help if clicking or feeling of ripping or instability  get it checked out by a foot doctor (podiatrist) hope this was helpful  if so please vote for me thanks!
1586,not usually these are usually symptoms of impending menses but can be seen with early pregnancy much depends on your menstrual pattern  but if you are pregnant  a home test will show it by 7-10 days from the missed period
1587,x-ray you need to be sure this is only a sprain and not a fracture get an x-ray and if no fracture then a lace up brace  otherwise you need to see an orthopedic surgeon
1588,nerve the pinky numbness could be an irritated or pinched nerve at the elbow or in the forearm (called cubital tunnel syndrome) however  if it seems to be starting at the shoulder it could be caused by a similar process in the armpit area (brachial plexus) or in the neck some vitamin deficiencies can cause nerve related pain (neuropathy) you should see your doctor
1589,headache who is weaning u off klonopin and why were u on it in the first place? my guess is ur headache is related to this but u should probably call ur doc
1590,possibilities several possible causes include infection (bacterial or viral)  cancer  allergies  or injury it is impossible to know without examining the spots you need to have a dentist examine the roof of your mouth to determine what the spots are  so see your dentist
1591,call and get checked there is still healing going on  but at this point you should not have much pain everyone is different you said that you only took antibiotics for 4 days thie typical prescription for most antibiotics is 7 to 10 days so you may not have taken enough to kills the infection if you still have significant pain or swelling it is best to call your oral surgeon and get this area checked
1592,could be either there is a lot of overlap between premenstrual symptoms and early pregnancy symptoms even light bleeding around the time of an expected period can occur with pregnancy a home pregnancy test and/or a blood test at your doctor's office may help clear things up after testing  if you are pregnant or still have unexplained symptoms consult your doctor
1593,not right something is not right the simplest explanation is that you are getting food in your lung  you need evaluation for that by a speech pathologist certainly  that is not the only possible reason
1594,all good options the options you mention are good and in the right order to use! (flexeril requires a prescription) if you didn't sustain an injury  it is likely tight neck muscles due to overuse range of motion exercises can help as well if it does not improve with over the counter medications soon consult your physician
1595,anemia looks like you are anemic  many things can cause that  including internal bleeding and chronic diseases wtih chest pain  you should always see a doctor right away to make sure you aren't having a heart attack call your doctor or go to the hospital
1596,normal  in context though the t4 & the free (direct) t4 levels are at the lower limit of normal range  do not put too much emphasis on it the t4 (and  therefore  the free t4) levels can vary a bit during the course of the day remember  these are hormones  and so there is some variation depending on how much the gland is putting out and the body is using that instant the tsh is your better guide  and it's normal
1597,no extensive workup  especially given age if everything is ok anatomically  and no abnormal cardiac rhythm  consider non cardiac causes
1598,good question! mammograms are of limited benefit in your 20's & not routinely ordered i advise you to see a breast surgeon to help put all these puzzle pieces together something is not adding up based on the info you are providing--a benign-appearing intramammary ln usually requires no further evaluation if anything  a directed ultrasound may corroborate these findings & allow easier follow-up
1599,rest  ice & elevate! some swelling after surgery is normal the amount and location may not be the type of surgery is important  but post-op care is a very big factor simple ice and elevation with range of motion exercises when called for can prevent or reduce swelling sometimes rest alone with elevation of the feet to eye level for several days will do it joint surgery usually requires motion to heal properly
1600,3-4 days i usually recommend a soft diet for 2-3 days following extraction but this depends on the extraction itself each peson heals differently so after a couple of days you can start eating foods that you can tolerate avoid hard chewy  chrunchy  and spicy foods until you are feeling better
1601,depends it does depend on the strength of the tooth generally if a tooth has a root canal it had multiple fillings before this possibly a fracture -it is compromised already even after all the time and financial commitments of restoring  the chances of that tooth surviving 3 -5 years is not great then you are back to getting an implant i try not to pay for things twice  but it is a decision between you
1602,problems still swelling is the tissue response to an injury or infection i would check with your dentist to see which of these exists the clicking indicates you have a problem inside the joint and since the back of the joint shares structures with the ear  there may be a relationship there as well that will require a more comprehensive evaluation and treatment as tmj problems don't cure themselves
1603,please don't play most likely your ankle is sprained it needs time to heal i know you probably like to play soccer a lot  but if you play now while your ankle is still healing there is a very good chance that you will hurt it worse and it will take longer to heal i would not play soccer for 1-2 weeks that way you can play later in the summer without a problem
1604,see an orthopedist and do this asap you could have blood in the joint space  may have torn ligaments or tendons and this needs to be examined  diagnosed and treated by an expert see an orthopedic surgeon soon  and good luck
1605,tight chest/ throat most cough with sore throat for few days are viral tight chest could mean asthma or bronchospasm or simply chest pain because of coughing   so i would suggest you to see a dr if you are asthmatic you need to use your bronchodilators the decision to use or not antibiotics is up the treating physician when there is a question for bacterial infections
1606,unlikely unlikely  but a 2nd opinion might be helpful
1607,check it out when in doubt you should check it out it is also important to try to determine why you became faint
1608,maybe the important thing is to make sure you are not having symptoms that could indicate bleeding inside the brain if you have unusual sleepiness  nausea  trouble walking straight  or anything else that is abnormal for you  you should see your doctor at once you might need further tests in most cases  though  your headache will go away and you'll be fine maybe a quieter party next year!
1609,doubtful tingling and numbness are not typical symptoms of tmd i would recommend that you see a dentist to address all your dental issues and evaluate your tmjoints  etc i am assuming that you are under the care of a physician for the polyneuropathy who can address the medical issues
1610,sciatica possibility what you describe could be sciatic nerve pain you should get it checked if it doesn't get better many possibilities can cause these symptoms
1611,no & maybe hcg should only be present in someone who is pregnant +hcg weeks before menses could indicate an early pregnancy  there are also uncommon tumors of the ovary that can cause +hcg levels in patient who are not pregnant (a couple of other very rare conditions can cause also) and  lastly  people who use hcg administration for weight loss will have + levels in their system
1612,see below it is possible that the cough is from a cold often the cough is due to nasal secretions and good irrigation may help if symptoms continue or worsen you should return to your doctor as the cold can progress you should be concerned if baby develops fever  flaring of the nostrils  very fast breathing  or pulling in of the ribs with breathing
1613,also consider lice! in my area it is an epidemic among grade school aged children if you're around any children  it might be worth combing through your hair with a lice comb to see if any of the little buggers are there if so treat for lice and you're cured! andlice prefer clean hair to dirty hair so this suggestion is no judgment on you!
1614,good idea typically recommend baseline at 35 in women who have first degree relative (mother) with breast cancer or  begin routine screening at 10 years younger than the age of the youngest relative w breast cancer at their age of diagnosis usually  will not screen with mammograms yearly in women younger than 30
1615,? bite the concern about infection expressed by the other doctors is correct but the itchiness makes me wonder if it is a bug bitesee your doctor
1616,you didnt inform us how the injury occured which would help nonetheless  i would recommend you see a foot doc who may decide to order an mri depending on their clinical findings important things to know would be is there any motion restriction? loss of power? in theory something could of ruptured
1617,initially ice packs ice packs if you feel the swelling is getting worse the cold will reduce the amount of blood going into your tissue causing bleeding once the internal bleeding has stopped  then warm packs to help move the excess blood away from the swollen site
1618,malocclusion malocclusion between the upper and lower teeth is the most likely explanation this can also be related to tmj and bruxism which may explain the night time symptoms your dentist or oral surgeon can help
1619,so sorry this is a very bad situation  and really not compatible with life beyond 2 or 3 months at most once the liver gets involved  and out of control  there is little intervention which would succeed might consider hospice care at this point all the best through this difficult time
1620,pl see your dentist antibiotics will only help so much the tooth needs to be evaluated by a dentist please inform that you are on warfarin as it might need to be stopped for a few days if the tooth needs to be extracted
1621,blood in stool blood in stool is always an issue of concern it may be that you have a hemorrhoid  but see your doctor for evaluation he may want to refer you to a gastroenerologist for further evaluation
1622,depends there is such a thing as non-celiac gluten sensitivity also possibility of other food problems would do a comprehensive digestive and stool analysis  which also checks for bad bugs and yeast and other things
1623,no no
1624,does not predict rather  an mri shows what did or did not occur in past instead pay attention to the true risk factors  such as smoking  hypertension  high triglycerides  hyprhomocysteinemia  prior heart disease  diabetes mellitus
1625,therapy ready for ? medications prescribed? please clarify

2059,symptomatic if you don't have gout or active arthritis  then quite likely you have nerve pain for that  you can try several things: such as liniments  lidoderm patches  or anticonvulsants--which are good for chronic nerve pain
2060,this can be due to either a fungus or a bacteria the key is do not pull at any of the peeling skin as this could cauase a bad infection you can try a topical antifungal agent if using creams better to use them at night so as when you walk it does not cause skin chafing betadine solution painted with a q tip is another option
2061,removal of the sourc many times chronic infections of the upper jaw (maxilla) and sinus area are associated with infected molar teeth whose roots can extend into the sinus area your local oral and maxillofacial surgeon should be able to perform several radiographic 3 dimensional studies to pinpoint the source of the infection if so  remove it and replace with a dental implant
2062,possible generally  superficial veins are not the ones that cause a deep vein thrombosis but anything is possible i would work with your medical doctor and have it evaluated you may need to see a vascular doctor for further treatment
2063,hopefully not! most patients with arthritis lead quite functional lives a number may have modest functional damage  but keep working! but i have patients with trivial problems  who want to drop out because of a diagnosis! most are not and will not become disabled!
2064,depends nucynta is a newer drug for people with a true narcotic allergy which is relatively rare it's a schedule 2  so similar to percocet/oxycodone in strength dosage depends partially on your tolerance to pain meds is  so someone with a history of a lot of paineds will need a higher dose that someone who hasn't taken much that said  average dosing is 50-100mg every 4-6hrs as needed for pain
2065,maybe both but usually when sinuses get infected the upper teeth become sore  the infection in the sinus can creat pressure which can push against the root of the teeth hence the sensitivity and soreness the rest of your question i hope an md can answer! hope you feel better soon!
2066,it depends full recovery after knee replacement usually takes more than a year most patients reduce their use of pain medicines within two weeks of the replacement  by 6 weeks they are comfortable and usually by 3 months the knee is fading into the background  and life doesn't revolve around the new knee everyone is different and this is a general time line if you are concerned tell your doctor
2067,you need to visit your internist  for a complete history and physical blood work sounds like a good idea as well do you take medications? any medical conditions? cramping in legs at night? or while walking? there are more questions that need to be answeredto help you
2068,see a breast doctor majority of the breast lumps are benign like beast cysts an ultrasound in addition to mammogra can help determine if a lump is a solid or a cystic lump cysts are almost always benign and sometimes they are painful solid lumps can be benign or cancerous after you had your mammogram you definitely need to see a doctor  preferably a breast specialst even if your mammogram report was negative
2069,second opinion? if the tooth was extracted 2 months ago  primary healing should be well underway if the adjacent teeth now hurt  you may have a secondary problem return to your dentist  or consider getting a second opinion no one should be upset or offended by that  and sometimes fresh eyes are good
2070,spotting sounds like low progesterone spotting before your period keep a menstrual diary and see if it gets normal next cycle if it persists  you may need a progesterone boost other things cause spotting like polyps  fibroids and infections and always consider pregnancy if it's a possibility
2071,evaluate for blood c any time you have surgery you are at risk for a clot in the deep veins(deep venous thrombosis) you have already had one so you may be prone to another swelling in the leg would be a symptom this should be evaluated with a vascular ultrasound asap
2072,possible possible but not not likely it usually takesore exposure than that
2073,copd? sounds like your cancer is cured  congratulations  you are one of few! you probably smoked and this lingering bronchitis may be uncontrolled copd check with your doctor for bronchodilators +/- steroids radiation pneumonitis would be very unusual after all this time
2074,checked for strep? a person with tonsillitis can be checked for strep throat at her doctor's office if there is strep  antibiotics are needed (usually amoxicillin) after 3 days or so  she should be well enough to gradually begin exercising again if her symptoms are viral and start improving after 3 days  she should be able to gradually resume exercising then too
2075,i would suggest you see an ent doctor and a neurologist ent's can do special barium swallowing studies by speech pathology to detect subtle functional swallowing issues a neuroloist might explore myasthenia gravis  although pain does not fit that
2076,lump being scared is a normal feeling however  do not let the fear take over your life if no strong family history of breast/ovarian cancer  having a normal mammo and sono are sufficient and they should put your mind on ease f/u with your md and have annual clinical breast exam and you can also do self breast checkbut  if you are at high risk-strong family history-mri need to be considered d/w md
2077,symptom free & ur ok has urine been check microscopically or a catheter specimen? that should have been next step was urinalysis repeated when u had the cystoscopy? urine dipstick will show falsely positive for wbcs from vaginal epithelial cells now you are clear after possible overinvestigation i do not think you need anything other than a repeat urine test with microscopy in 3 months consider another dr
2078,pillow there is no physical reason preventing you from sleeping on your side you might try a pillow between your legs if you find it uncomfortable while your knee recovers
2079,yes first very close follow up by the oncologist  preventing osteoporosis  zometa will help ske ( skeletal related events   like fractures joint and muscle problems ) in 40%   risk of metastasis in 14 %   speak to your oncologist
2080,must r/o herpes it can present that way   see your gyn today for an exam and gyn can do cultures to seeif it is that or anything else and u can get started on txmemt for whatever your gyn thinks it is while your gyn is waiting for the cultures to come back  that is what i do with my pts
2081,not typical ms firstly mri is imaging of choice for ms  not ct secondly  symptoms you describe are very non-specific head tension and popping ears are definitely atypical if it's not ms  what does your neurologist think it is? if you don't get a satisfactory answer  get a second opinion
2082,see doc there are many treatments  including a new one with the name daliresp
2083,it depends it would have to be a quite severe fracture to need an amputation these days an external fixator can be put on to allow healing of most comminuted really awful fractures then revisional surgery is done later only fractures that cut off the blood supply to the foot or have a nasty infection would need an amputation
2084,normal swelling swelling may stll be present in the palm it is not unusual for the palm to still fell a little bit full or tight the normal indentation or inverted v that on sees when you look at your palm in profile may be absent some also feel a pulling sensation when the extend their wrists and it can feel like forearm tightness gentle stretching and massage can be helpful too
2085,probably if you have a complex tear of the medial meniscal cartilage  then it usually does not heal on its own limited range of motion can occur when the cartilage is broken or flipped out of position if your pain persist  you will probably need endoscopic surgery ask your doctor for a referral to an orthopedic doctor
2086,ask neck surgeon your neck surgeon has the definitive answer based on your actual surgery  as well as how your healing has progressed an elective cosmetic surgery should not be undertaken when there is any risk to your neck; your neck will likely need to be hyperextended for anesthesia  and unless fully and durably healed (x-ray?)  this could be a major risk talk frankly with your neck surgeon about your plan!
2087,no not at all derms agree that topical vitamin e may cause a contact dermatitis and it has no anti acne effects
2088,depends you should see your doctor there is no way to tell what is going on without a physical exam and a thorough history 
2089,neck evaluation a ponched nerve in your neck can do this c6 nerve root can do this that would bbe a disc herniation at c5-6
2090,possibilties yes  you can experience diplopia from multiple sclerosis  brainstem strokes  and myasthenia gravis  and all can be sorted out by an expert neurologist a number of diagnostic tests can readily sort out these disorders  and confirm causation
2091,consider chest ct you need to talk to your doctor about ways to stop smoking  which is a known cause of lung cancer that's the 1st thing you need to do a negative chest x-ray does not mean your lungs are free of disease assuming the mris were of your spine  consider an optimized screening chest ct to determine the status of your lungs and reduce your anxiety
2092,you need to be re-evaluated by your physician you should check the report of the mammogram  don't assume anything incidentally  federal mqsa regulations require that a patient be notified  in writing  of mammo results within 30 days if you didn't get a letter  your facility may not be in compliance with the law
2093,a lot depends on where the break is at if it is not into a joint  there should be little worry about displacement or not  based in the information you gave from two other doctors no surgery now!
2094,spinal issue? hand and feet nerve symptoms can manifest themselves during activity and/or rest in your case  it might be the loading vertically of the spine when sitting that causes the lumbar and brachial plexus to be compressed  causing a nerve entrapment seek out a spinal surgeon or neurologist for more definitive testing and examination
2095,depends every situation is different some wisdom teeth are bony impacted  some are infection or abcessed it also depends on the type and size of the bone graft being compared to it is difficult to provide a comparison
2096,not carpal tunnel first off the description is of physical characteristics which is something distinct from symptoms symptoms of carpal tunnel would typically be related to entrapment of the median nerve ie numbness  tingling and weakness of the hand i'm not aware that this occurs to any greater degree in someone with long fingers though a thin wrist might certainly predispose to compression of the nerve
2097,it is possible certainly  you have symptoms that sound very ms like but  i cannot say for sure without more info  an exam and mris of your brain/neck
2098,possible bakers cyst as well as nerve entrapment see an orthopedist
2099,allergic reaction you could be allergic to medication  food  perfume  something in soap or lotion see physician
2100,varies recovery from an ankle sprain is highly variable it depends on the degree of ligament tearing  the need and compliance with immobilization (boot  cast  brace)  compliance with relative rest and the success with rehab at times  occult ( hard to diagnose) fractures or bone bruising create longer recovery periods average full recovery from a typical sprain is 1-2 months
2101,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
2102,yes the first thing you should have is a ultrasound of your leg to evaluate for a deep venous thrombosis (dvt) this is a painless and quick test  but very important let your primary care doctor know
2103,most likely! yes  most likely with the mri and a chest xray  if there is any cause for your symptoms  it would most likely identify  any lesion more than 3-5mm in the chest or the spine i am sure your doc would be able to help you once ha has all the results
2104,yes  it can this is why women are encouraged to do a self exam regularly  like every month or so it can still be benign  but cancer must be ruled out mammograms at a certain age are also very important for the same reason so the next step is to see your doctor to get this examined with tests  and the like  to find out exactly what this is
2105,yes most plastic surgeons feel comfortable performing breast augmentation surgery while patients remain on birth control medications however  although controversial  some plastic surgeons are also concerned about the potential for deep venous thrombosis (clots)  which may be a greater risk for patients who are on certain types of oral contraceptives
2106,see your doc you should report this lump to your doctor asap
2107,bad headache the answer would depend largely on how long have you had this type of headache if this is a pattern you have had for many years  then the chances of some type oof pathology are low if it is a very recent onset  then it should be investigated by a qulified headache specialist
2108,read below breast cancer can progress or recur in case chemotherapy is not working well against cancer ct scan is the best way to look for cancer in the lungs and liver but it can only show shadows which often require further tests either a biopsy or a pet scan if there is any uncertainty about the cause of the shadows sometimes radiotherapy can cause shadows on the lungsso not all shadows are mets
2109,strep throat if sore throat and fever are only symptoms you have  the chance of strep throat is high need to see your pcp
2110,might be a ganglion if you notice a localized area of swelling in the ball of the foot  it might be a ganglionic cyst  bursa  or neuroma impingement on the nerve can cause numbness usually in congestive heart failure  swelling looks more generalized in the feet  ankles and legs if you press on the swelling  and it leaves a dent  that is fluid retention and might be due to your heart
2111,sometimes when a child's anemia reaches levels where therapeutic iron is needed  cramps & constipation are seen occasionally full srength juices will sometimes counter the effect it is not seen from the iron content of regular formulas
2112,no no  it sounds like viral  do symptomatic therapy  give pedialyte for fluids  if baby feels ok  not lethargic  drinks fluids  wets dipers as usual  fever below 104  and still active do not worry  you might still want to bring baby to pediatrician to check and make sure that no prescriptions needed if fever is below 101 and baby is active and tolerating it let it run
2113,consult oncologist! for estrogen or progesterone positive receptor cancer of breast: hormone manipulation: estrogen receptor inhibitors-tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors-arimidex  aromasin  letrosole etc !
2114,yes it is possible yes bacteria could have accumulated below the gum line while the tooth was coming in and caused the cavity to occur
2115,tingling after ctr very normal to have tingling after carpal tunnel surgery! it usually represents swelling in the immediate area of the nerve elevate the hands whenever possible and as the swelling decreases  so should the tingling! best of luck!
2116,consider fixing it there are procedures to fix damaged ligaments and also to decompress an entrapped nerve
2117,scaphoid fracture numbness may be the result of awkward positioning or a tight cast or splint if present contact your doctor for instructions re: loosening the cast or splint sometimes people can develop carpal tunnel syndrome following an injury rarely direct nerve injury from several causes may be the culprit discuss your symptoms with your treating physician for proper evaluation and treatment
2118,increased risk using combined hormone therapy after menopause increases the risk of getting breast cancer it may also increase the chances of dying from breast cancer this increase in risk can be seen with as little as 2 years of use combined ht also increases the likelihood that the cancer may be found at a more advanced stage
2119,yes exercise is important to maintaining many aspects of health walking is typically well tolerated by an artificial joint use common sense to guide your initial efforts start slowly and add duration/distance in small increments
2120,robert j spinner robert j spinner at the mayo clinic is the national expert in peripheral nerve injury and nerve reconstruction
2121,endoscopic or open? it depends if you had the traditional open decompression  then that is normal on average  it takes 3 to 6 months to fully heal if you had it done endoscopically like i do it  with no incision on the hand  then most are fully back to work without restrictions within a few days  and fully healed in a few weeks so in short  it depends mostly on who did your surgery  and how it was done
2122,not long at all some patients may have discomfort for the first day other patients may be a few days depends on how smooth the procedure went  if the tooth was infected and the patient (if there are any medical issues)
2123,see your dentist you should return the dentist who performed your surgery for evaluation and determination of the cause of the recurring infection x-rays or additional studies may be performed and depending on the findings  a minor surgical procedure may also be required to resolve the problem
2124,many asthma  anxiety  fibromyalgia  systemic diseases  bead through check up
2125,get checked get checked for autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis  sjögren's syndrome  scleroderma  lupus  etc  see a rheumatologist they will examine you and order appropriate tests if needed
2126,sure you might do better with stable methadone 5 mg 2x-3x a day this should keep a stable blood level of pain medicine rather than the up and down plasma level of vicodin
2127,swollen gum if it gets worse or she has a fever call your doctor and dentist they can help you make sure it's not an abcess or infection
2128,only aspirin daily only aspirin is indicated for prevention of heart attack acetaminophen and ibuprophen are not used and not recommended for prevention of heart attack
2129,not likely mvp typically doesn't cause too many problems in an otherwise healthy person if there is an underlying heart problem or other disease process at work  then all bets are off while it may be associated with it  the mvp isn't likely to be the direct cause
2130,cyst or drainage? these do sometimes track pretty far down the leg it could certainly be the cyst itself if it remains on the posterior aspect of the leg another possibility is that it has caused some pressure on one of the large veins behind the knee causing swelling at both the leg in the ankle i would see an orthopedic surgeon to help make a diagnosis and guide treatment
2131,absolutely saline irrigation of the nose is safe and effective i encourage all my nasal allergy patients to rinse their nose there are also non=allergic forms of nasal disease as well as chronic sinusitis  where nasal irrigation is crucial
2132,abdominal exam first the obvious concern is to first rule out an ovarian cancer- with a good gyn and abdominal exam  ct  and ca-125 tumor marker with personal history of breast cancer before 38 and mother with ovarian  brca testing should be done treatments options will follow from there and may include removal of ovaries and uterus  prophylactic mastectomy and/or close surveillance
2133,i would think if you do they are 2 separate problems
2134,yes and no loosing blood from an extraqction can be monitored and stopped with pressure internal bleeding can go unnoticed and can be life threatening i am not sure what information you are looking for in your question hope this info helps
2135,probably teething it depends where the areas in the mouth are from the description it looks like teething you can have a pediatric dentist take a look to make sure that everything is fine
2136,depends it would be great if the answer was a definitive yes and  though the way you describe it  it seems likely  but it depends on the type of cancer  the extent of involvement  and the size of metastases also  if there are obscuring findings  like a diffuse pneumonia  it might be difficult to pick up on x-ray
2137,yes  yes  it is too early for you to get a mammogram at this age  focus on self breast exams and familiarize yourself with the way your breasts feel so that you can notice if a lump develops in the future mammograms in young females are often extremely difficult to interpret because the breast tissue is so dense it hides most lesions screening for breast cancer using mammography starts at age 40 if you have a sister or mother who were diagnosed with breast cancer when they were younger than 50 years of age  then screening with breast mri and genetic testing may be indicated
2138,varies w individual every person is different in how they perceive pain most will be sore for 3 days to 2 weeks same is true for work your are completely healed around 6 weeks you should avoid upper body excercises for at least 6 weeks brignonimdcom
2139,no data no data to support taking a vaccine in your 50s especially after having already contracted hpv

2141,chronic chronic ear fluid is a common problem for a lot of kids because the eustachian tube (the tube that drains the ear into the throat) is narrow and winding in kids  it can often stop draining properly and cause chronic fluid or frequent ear infections the good news is that as children grow  the tubes grow also becoming wider and straighter to allow for proper drainage for most adults the bad news is that this doesn't happen overnight since there are no medications shown to alleviate the pressure or drain the fluid from behind the ear drum  it has to be done with a suction and/or ear tubes you can try giving motrin or tylenol for the ear discomfort  but the fluid will either have to drain out on its own (unlikely given your son's history) or drain out when the tube is placed legal disclaimer: i am providing this general and basic information as a public service and my response to this question does not constitute a doctor-patient relationship for any additional information  advice  or specific concerns  please speak with your own physician the information provided is current as of the date of the answer entry
2142,venous ultrasound yes  there are many causes of leg swelling a venous ultrasound of the legs done by a vein specialist can rule out vein disease and then you can move on heaviness  swelling  restless legs etc can result from venous reflux  backward flow of blood backwards down the legs with prolonged standing and sitting due to inherited valve disorder can be treated in office procedures wwwphlebologyorg
2143,95% 95% of patients having elective cholecystectomy in my practice do not require urinary catheterization the procedure is usually short  less than 30 minutes and muscle relaxants usually wear off rapidly obviating urinary retention the exceptions are usually elderly males with prostate enlargement and most of these patients are able to void prior to discharge using and in and out bladder drainage procedure
2144,another another you can and should take in consideration is a ligament injury for a precise evaluation go talk to a hand surgeon he or she may suggest a mri which can help confirm the injury
2145,here are some  clinically  i agree with my colleague stating musculoskeletal origin as a culprit for pain as described for a 91-year-old man  bring the detailed info on his voiding history and pain near left hip & lower back stressing their quality  quantity  and sequence of events over time to doc for analysis  physical exam  & tests such as residual urine  urinalysis  renal function  etc so to define cause
2146,examination sounds like sinusitis you can try over the counter decongestants and ibuprofen the dizzy is due to the inner ear adjacent to the sinuses being affected
2147,cts carpal tunnel syndrome is number one on the list
2148,probably not i agree with drs hansen and d ipl might work for very fine spider veins but if your veins are bulging  you are liekly to be disappointed with the results you get from ipl i would recommend seeing a vein specialist (phlebologist) who can evaluate your legs to make sure that there is no undersying vein trouble if there isn't  then smaller veins can probably best be treated with sclerotherapy
2149,possibly asthma is recurrent episodes of bronchospasm and airway inflammation it is possible for these episodes to occur only with infections
2150,bakers cyst? if you have a swelling in back of your knee  it isa very common place for a cyst to form see your orthopedist for evaluation and treatment
2151,pediatrician how about starting with your child's pediatrician? he or she is likely to be very experienced in treating eczema in children as this is a very common skin problem if your pediatrician feels it is medically necessary  he/she may subsequently refer you to a dermatologist if necessary
2152,arrhythmia mitral valve prolapse is typically asymptomatic by itself but can be associated with some abnormal heart rhythms which can be symptomatic
2153,hard to say one white spot on brain mri is nonspecific if it is in a particular area (corpus callosum) it would be more concerning  otherwise it could have been from prior brain infection (encephalitis) or trauma (shearing injury) your symptoms are a bit more worrisome perhaps a spinal fluid analysis will help neurology consult would be useful
2154,monitoring centers lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells/digested food lymph nodes taste the lymph everywhere for bad stuff like bacteria/viruses/cancers  etc when it detects a problem  it alerts the immune system and your body reacts they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react they shrink when all is well
2155,thin chest wall if he has a thin chest well he may be feeling his heart hitting up against his chest wall like a ping pong ball nothing serious
2156,you will need all breast cancer in stage 2 still needs a lumpectomy and nodal evaluation which is surgery afterward chemo and radiation is often recommended
2157,everyone's everyone's body reacts differently  however most people have significant discomfort/pain for about 2 days  then begin to improve i have seen some patients be quite painful for a week be sure to use the medications as prescribed for pain and you will most likely do well
2158,depends patients taking bisphosphonates for osteoporosis are at greater risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw from surgical procedures the injectables or iv meds are most likely to cause problems the oral meds are not as bad for complications  your dr may take you off reclast for a period of time before the extraction please discuss this w your physician and oral surgeon! good luck!
2159,yes new chemotherapy agents have been introduced there are also newer types of rmachines and techniques however in regards to radiation if you had the same exact problem now versus 13 years ago the treatment might be exactly the same
2160,i'm i'm sorry you're having problems with your legs and feet unfortunately  without an examination and further testing (nerve conduction studies  repeat mri of your lower back  etc) it's simply not possible to determine why you're having these symptoms depending on the type of surgery you had  your numbness could be caused by transient inflammation and swelling around the surgical site such swelling could compress nearby nerve roots and cause numbness in your lower extremities alternatively  it's possible your legs or ankles were crossed or compressed during surgery or shortly thereafter  when you were too sedated to change positions this could cause a palsy in one or more of the peripheral nerves in your legs given time  this  too  should resolve finally  it's possible you experienced some as yet undetected damage during your surgery that injured the nerves in your back if that's the case  your numbness might be permanent you may need to consult a neurologist or neurosurgeon to get the answers to your questions i hope things go well for you!
2161,your your description of your symptoms of right sided pain that goes into the back  gas and belching  sounds very much like the symptoms many people describe from their gallstones the symptoms are usually made worse after eating  especially if fatty or fried foods once symptoms develop  often people note that the frequency of their ill feeling may increase  or happen more often there is probably little benefit to wait to get more illness or have episodes of vomiting an ultrasound is usually sufficient unless there are some unusual problems that you are having that would require a ct scan your doctor or surgeon can discuss with you the best tests for your specific conditions laparoscopic surgery for gallbladder removal is often an outpatient surgery that one can recover from fairly quickly  in 2 weeks or less
2162,bleeding bleeding behind the eye is a relatively rare problem possible causes could include a ruptured aneurysm or trauma of some sort if instead this is bleedin inside of the eye  in the back  a careful examination by an ophthalmologist woudl help i would suggest that you ask your doctor for the cause of this problem
2163,not not all fractures show up on a standard x-ray  especially if they're hairline fractures if you're starting to see bruising  you might have a little fracture it takes 14 days for bone callus to be visible on an x-ray (bone callus is this white  fuzzy looking stuff that surrounds fractures as one of the stages of fracture healing)  so you might want to have your ankle re-x-rayed after 2 weeks to see if there is bone callus if you still have problems  an mri would not only be able to show an occult fracture  but would also tell if you tore one or more ligaments
2164,as as dr wint notes  the dark color under the nail is like a bruise when the nailbed (the area under the hard nail) gets injured  blood gets trapped under the nail depending on the amount of bleeding  the area may be large and start to elevate the nail a very large area will cause the nail to fall off there can be a broken bone (fracture is the same thing) under the nail most of these do not need treatment and heal well  even if they look exploded (comminuted)  but should at least be x-rayed if the fracture is big enough to involve the joint or distorts the bone too much (displaced)  it may need further care  such as splinting or surgery a particularly painful blood collection  called a subungal hematoma  is relatively common after a crush injury such as this many people will drain them to relieve the pressure and pain by burning a small hole in the fingernail in the case of a broken bone  though  this increased the risk of infection  though the risk is still relatively small there is also discussion about how much bruising to accept before repairing the nailbed some people argue that if the bruise is more than half the nail  it should be removed and the nailbed repaired i disagree i think the nail is the best splint for the nailbed and is best left in place to help mold the healing tissue
2165,if if it is all the way in the back it might be what is called a pericoronitis an infection of the gum over a partially erupted wisdom tooth try to brush it to clean it out  and you will have to see your dentist to either resolve the infection  or remove the wisdome tooth
2166,sleep sleep apnea is the interruption of your normal sleep pattern by a failure to breath consistently your breath is arrested by the tissue of your throat falling back and blocking the breathing airway when you are are accumulating so much carbon dioxide in your blood stream that your body sensors tell you that you are close to being poisoned by it an emergency response waken you and you choke and splutter until the airway is open and you can get a gasp of air this process blows off some of the carbon dioxide and allows you to return to a fitful sleep you will notice it is not about the oxygen so necessary to keep your brain alive and you body functioning people who have apnea can suffer brain damage and even die from suffocation you dentist is goin to talk to you about a device worn in the mouth that will pull the lower jaw forwards so that the tissues of the throat are less like to block the airway while you sleep this can be a life saving device what can you expect? well a few days getting used to the appliance  may be some additional dental appointment for adjustments you can expect to sleep more restfully and not be so tired during the day which prevents you from thinking clearly you might actually live longer it is possible that you will have bad breath from mouth breathing  so get used to needing to be extra good about oral hygeine  brush floss and rinse! dr neil mcleod dds dentistry that lasts - quality that counts
2167,symptoms = surgery symptomatic gallstones are an indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy not an emergency but don't wait forever
2168,see your dentist see your dentist first if you are not feeling better  or confident in your current dental office  seek another opinion see an oral surgeon know that there are specialists for dentures -- prosthodontists
2169,yes the glands are lymph nodes which are part of your body's defense mechanism when fighting off infection  they may swell up and become tender the location of the sores you mention and the swelling of the glands leads me to suspect that you might be having an episode of herpes in conjunction with the aphthous ulcers you might want to see your dentist or family md for an evaluation feel better
2170,are are we sure this is a lymph node? an isolated lymph node in the suboccipital area would be unusual unless there were inflammatory/infectious processes of the posterior scalp skin or very rarely spread of skin cancers did it appear at the time of your other symptoms or has it possibly been present for some time and you now just noticed it sebaceous cysts (blocked oil glands) or small lipomas (fatty tumors-benign) can be mistaken for a lymph node if it persists beyond 3-4 weeks it would be reasonable to have it looked at if it remains swollen and tender (not usually a characteristic of a malignant lymph node) a course of appropriate antiobiotics and short term oral steroids wouldn't be inappropriate
2171,you can eat however  if left untreated  it can put you at greater risk of systemic problems such as blood infection  breathing problems and heart disease see a dentist for definitive treatment

2173,breast cancer i perform immediate breast reconstruction on patients every week who will get radiation treatments i prefer to perform the diep flap for patients who i know will get radiated because i can take care of your own tissue much easier than an implant after radiation the only time i don't perform or delay the reconstruction is when the tumor is close to the chest wall and maybe difficult to check

2178,hello hello i certainly hope that your bleeding has stopped it has been some time since your surgery do they plan to get another ct scan to see if blood has resorbed or if there is still bleeding? often surgeons work in treatment teams  where they can ask for input from colleages if your surgeon isn't sure how he or she plans to proceed  ask if obtaining a second opinion would be helpful

2191,no get something that works the best over-the-counter remedy is benzoyl peroxide  and it's not very good your physician may add topical clindamycin (my favorite and very cheap) or the more pricey retinoic acid derivatives (good if there's a lot of blackheads) if this isn't good enough  move to a systemic antibiotic  or a dermatologist has the big guns you need not have unwanted acne  good luck
2192,don't stop now! the purpose of all the treatment is to reduce your risk of recurrence you are fortunate to have a chance at cure if it recurs it is deadly the hardest part is behind you (chemotherapy) yet the most important treatment   that lowers your risk the most  is what's left talk to your doctors and counselors! good luck

2207,dose dependent the risk of cancer is related to the degree of radiation exposure the dose from diagnostic ct scans is not insignificant  but keep in mind that you would have to have several to increase your risk even slightly a recent study showed that ct scans in children can increase the risk of cancer (brain and leukemia)  but the overall effect is small  translating into one additional cancer among 10000

2218,amox not great amoxicillin is not a great drug for sinusitis amoxicillin + clavulante (augmentin) is preferred a short course of steroids (prednisone) may be helpful as well but if you have had symptoms this long  i would see your local ent there are some newer technologies to open your sinuses up in the clinic using balloon technology like angioplasty: acclarentcom

2224,also lyme disease if you have been bitten by a tick or live near the woods (or frequently go camping)  consider getting tested for lyme disease as well some of the symptoms  especially the (migratory?) rash are reminiscent of lyme disease
2225,false tests although urine preg tests are much more accurate than in past  they can still give false results if in doubt  a quantitative b-hcg test (blood) should be done this will measure not just positive or negative but toatl value to follow and confirm a healthy pregnancy will double value every 2-3 days if positive but staying same or going down  concern for miscarriage or tubal preg
2226,late period sounds like just a late period but check a pregnancy test to be sure
2227,lymph nodes the lymph nodes usually enlarge as response to an infection in the vicinity it lasts maximum 2-3 weeks and as the infection goes away (with antibiotics usually) the lymph nodes disappear outside this scenario  i would be worried and demand further investigation (ct is appropriate  a blood smear and cbc with differential  as well as a bmp with enzymes markers analysis) up to an excision biopy

2234,she won't i used to always ask surgeons to do a sentinel node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy for that very reason however  newer data show the lymph node status after chemotherapy may be more important newer data also show that women don't always need a full axillary dissection with a few positive nodes  so i'm ok with either approach if the lymph nodes aren't enlarged to start
2235,possible dry socket contact your dentist or oral surgeon who removed the teeth to determine if this could be normal discomfort or a dry socket a dry socket may occur if the initial blood clot was lost this can occur if you smoke or drink from a straw the strong negative pressure caused by the sucking on the cigarette or straw  can pull the clot loose

2350,fever sore throat would get a strep test because the complications of untreated strep can be significant  rheuamtic fever  rarely endocarditis so would go to urgent care and do strep test or better have them send out a culture  strep can cause tonsillitis   it is just a worse infection then just the sore throat coudl also be from post nasal drip  viral   mycoplasma  reflux but get a strep test

2395,pain plantar fasciitis can result in pain in a lot of places - not just the feet you could also have osteoarthritis in those other weight bearing joints see your podiatrist - orthotics help with plantar fasciitis about 95% of the time in my practice they just might help those other areas as well by getting 'things' aligned  good luck

2421,possible  plus  rarely the gb duct does not remain sealed after gb removed or the bile duct is nicked  either way resulting in a bile leak and persistent problems ultrasound? if this is the case  the sphincter of oddi could be an issue; stenting it open for several weeks often resolves such problems however  many other possibilities; post-op pain and/or other (nominally unrelated to gb/liver) issues going on

2441,numbness to know for sure  you need an examination differential diagnosis could be c8 cervical radiculopathy (pinched nerve in neck)  brachial plexopathy  peripheral nerve entrapment such as ulnar neuropathy  or even myofascial pain with trigger points would suggest a pm&r evaluation for definitive diagnosis and treatment

2862,recommended in patients with diabetes  the recommended level for ldl is below 100 if you are already doing a fairly good job of avoiding fats in your diet  then additional treatment  most commonly with a statin  would be recommended to bring your ldl down to the desired level
2863,mri guidelines mri of brain and spinal cord may show areas of abnormal signal which are consistent with ms but must be taken in the context of the individual's clinical course  objective findings on the neurological exam  and no better explanation forthcoming ms diagnosis can be supported by mri findings  often with additional support from spinal fluid abnormalities consistent with the diagnosis
2864,possibly repeat test occult testing often leads to false positives abnormal test results may occur after eating meat  a nosebleed or gum bleed it does not necessarily indicate internal bleeding with stage iiib lung cancer and severe copd  i suspect your doctor believes there is really no benefit to further testing due to these very severe illnesses that will probably limit lifespan
2865,maybe but you need to have this checked out to see what damage has actually occurred and what can be done to heal ankle orthotics and supportive shoes are also important refrain from weightbearing activity
2866,not necessarily  fish oil will not lower total cholesterol and may in fact increase ldl you need a statin or niacin  see your doctor
2867,yes in fact  lithium is probably the best/most studied medication for the treatment of bipolar disorder it is very effective in many but not all cases it has been shown to be the most effective treatment for suicidality it can be safe and effective  especially for bipolar i disorder or a manic episode
2868,can be quite similar vascular dementia causes deficits in the areas of the brain affected by stroke alzheimers disease causes problems with memory  language  making decisions  planning multistep tasks and gradual decline in functioning behavioral symptoms - hallucinations  delusions  depression  anxiety  agitation  aggression  irritability  disinhibition  apathy  can occur with both illnesses some folks have both
2869,yes in some cases hormonal treatment can be as effective as chemotherapy however if there is benefit from chemotherapy then it would be in addition to hormonal therapy you should ask what percent benefit chemotherapy would give your circumstance and then decide if it's worth it to you to not accept that benefit
2870,you need to contact your dr asap
2871,maybe however  bulging discs are usually normal findings  a further workup may be needed to rule out other sources such as a neuropathy ( which may have various causes like diabetes) or a higher level problem with your spine you should see a neurologist for a detailed workup
2872,consider uae for women with symptomatic fibroids and adenomyosis who dont respond to medical management  there are really only 2 choices: uterine artery embolization (uae) or hysterectomy i prefer uae as its non-surgical and if successful would allow a woman to keep her uterus the clinical success rate for uae with adenomyosis is not as high as it is for fibroids (70% vs 90%) but worth risk in my opinion
2873,rf - rheum arthritis you could have rheumatoid factor negative (rf-) rheumatoid arthritis not likely gout without crystals in fluid other possibilities are pseudo gout or lupus you may want to see a rheumatologist
2874,uric acid stones yes  this is possible: uric acid stones are not very radio-opaque - so plain xray miss them; so might ct  unless contrast is used ultrasound will not miss them  unless small - less than 5 mm
2875,most likely  not degenerative disc disease is a form of arthritis involving the articulations of the spine as the disease progresses  the articulations become more and more dysfunctional many times the disease is self limiting and can be managed medically sometimes the articulations have to be stabilized surgically
2876,rashes rashes are tough hard to tell w/o seeing it and a good history and physicalsee your primary care physicianpossible referral for dermatology or podiatry
2877,ultrasound results what you are describing are ultrasound results a hypoechoic nodule of 3 mm of size is nearly 100% benign the only reason to assess if a nodule is overactive (hot) or underactive (cold) is in general hyperthyroidism if the nodule is hot  then it can be the target of therapy this is done through a i-131 uptake and scan
2878,go to er don't mess around go to er if these symptoms exist a heart attack can cause tooth and jaw pain especially on the left side
2879,eczema? rubella? many conditions can cause generalized swollen lymph nodes rubella pops to mind immediately but any skin inflammation can lead to swollen regional nodes elbow lymph node enlargement used to be a sign of syphilis please have them checked by his pediatrician to find out the cause
2880,see your dr ongoing headaches like this are not normal see your neurologist for a formal workup this needs to be looked into
2881,should be evaluated although the majority of lumps and bumps that appear on arms and legs are benign the only way to be sure is to see a doctor and have it examined sometimes an mri is needed to make the diagnosis best not to ignore it especially if it is painful or sensitive
2882,possible better to be in the hospital get checked out it may not be heart related in a 22 year old  but can't be sure
2883,several things the most common is incomplete emptying of the bladder because of an enlarged prostate
2884,remember the moa as an aside  it's important to remember how these meds work your allergies are caused by histamine release in the body antihistamines block the release of histamine  not its effects its important therefore to take allergy medicine prior to experiencing the allergy symptoms antihistamines are to prevent allergy symptoms  not get rid of them once they've already shown up
2885,stress fractures can cause long term swelling repetitive trauma to an area that underwent a stress fracture will continue to have stress-induced swelling if you are not wearing an orthotic in your shoe that helps to displace pressure and impact trauma away from the fracture site  then you will continue to have stress-type symptoms in that area  including post-injury swelling
2886,unexplained infertil it sounds like you are describing unexplained infertility most obgyns are limited in treatment they can provide for fertility but clomid is something they can do to get more treatment or to rule out other problems you would need a fertility consultation with a specialist for unexplained infertility  clomid alone has not generally found to be as effective as clomid combined with insemination
2887,needs to be removed in general  of an infected scalp cyst has a persistent infection unresponsive to antibiotic therapy  the lining will need to be removed and the wound may need to be left open it generally takes a few weeks for the open wound to heal from the bottom up  and it needs to be packed with gauze which is changed 1-3 times per day
2888,nope you can have it drained  but ganglions come back more often after drainage than after surgical removal drainage involves the doctor sticking the ganglion with a needle and aspirating the thick fluid out with a syringe good luck
2889,a comon condition this is a frequently occurring condition it should have completely resolved since july an ultrasound will confirm that it is gone
2890,norma/concerning when our skin sustains an injury  immediate response is inflammation (red  hot  tender swelling) for about 48-72 hours this is the body increasing blood flow to the area to bring healing factors and is normal healing if it gets worse over time (increase in pain  fevers  chills  more redness)  then it may be infected or the lupus may be reacting if so  then seeing the doc may be your best bet
2891,yes jumping exercises aggravate the condition  but swimming is safe
2892,pretty high i would simply say that if you are infected  you will likely transmit it to your loved one if you don't take appropriate precautions unprotected activity will contaminate your partner
2893,bug bites?? if the spots don't increase  they might be just bug bites if they keep increasing  then they might be hives  an allergic reaction (of course there could also be multiple bugs causing new bites) otc creams or gels that contain 1% hydrocortisone or the skin anesthetic pramoxine can both be helpful (the dr can advise on what age range the meds can be used in) the dr may want to examine the rash
2894,not at all typically nondisplaced fractures of the toes can be treated with a post-op walking shoe or nothing at all depending on the amount of pain you are having
2895,unrx'd cancer grows while it is true that as many as 90% of all breast cancers are environmental in origin  it is difficult if not impossible to identify the specific cause of your cancer regardless  once diagnosed  breast cancer is eminently treatable left untreated  it will continue to grow please seek out medical care if you haven't already done so good luck
2896,contagious after rx usually  the a general guideline would be that a person is not contagious after 48 hours' worth of antibiotics with strep throat  a general guideline is 24 hours but this can vary depending on the disease
2897,no and yes not all cancers bleed  and elevated or low wbc count is not specific for colon cancer if undiagnosed  it will obstruct the flow of fecal material and or bleed  once it gets to a larger size
2898,glasses don't change wearing glasses refocuses the eyes do that the brains gets a clear image this helps prevent amblyopia (lazy eye) in children wearing glasses does not affect the growth of the eye and won't increase or decrease the changes in shape of the eye over time the biggest reason to wear glasses is to ensure normal vision development (prevent amblyopia)
2899,allergy reaction head ache   migraine is very common allergic reaction to caffeine  see your doctor  stop drinking coffee tea and cola which contain caffeine   before blaming aneurysm  and brain tumor
2900,not related the inr is not used to come off the warfarin inr is a measure of the blood clotting ability and is used to monitor the effect of the warfarin the goal is between 2 and 3 if less than 2  the warfarin effect is not enough to protect one and > 3 it causes excess bleeding risk the duration of therapy depends on circumstances surrounding the dvt and can range from 3 months to lifetime treatment
2901,several months after starting warfarin the blood clot can no longer grow the body will start to break down the clot within days it takes months to have the clot reabsorbed or for the process to make an opening through the clot so blood can get through again swelling will be visibly less in a few weeks but it could be 6 months before the leg is back to normal occasionally  the swelling persists indefinitely
2902,maybe might have existed before the surgery could be related to poor production  decreased outflow (lacrimal drain issues)  reflexive with poor tear film or lid position making incisions on the cornea sometimes affects the feedback loop of the cornea and tears
2903,not aware of diet i am not aware of diet to reduce the size of fibroids
2904,surgeon follow up even with the great advances in medicine  there is still no such thing as a risk free surgery every surgery runs the risk of developing complications pain and burning may be normal in the immediate post operative period close follow up with his surgeon is encouraged to ensure these symptoms are normal and not the result of unwanted complications
2905,need oncotype-dx while your prognosis is excellent  we know that some women with your stage may benefit from traditional chemotherapy in addition to an aromatase inhibitor nowadays  we are moving towards molecular staging over anatomic staging; oncotype-dx is a multi-gene assay that can provide information regarding your probability of recurrence; if it is high  traditional chemo will be recommended
2906,very rare  but well-recognized complication of breast radiation therapy (of course  when you are that one in a million  that doesn't help) modern techniques are designed to maximize rx to the breast & minimize effects on the heart and lungs your radiation oncologist certainly should have discussed this with you pre-treatment--informed consent is a necessary part of any rx regimen
2907,possibly more important is the pathology we rely on pathology and the immunochemistry the pet may be helpful but sometimes we do not find a primary this is called a cancer of unknown primary
2908,bump with pain there are several possibilities  including a stye and an abscess if t is tender  it may be infected an abscess needs to be drained by a skilled eye surgeon (ophthalmologist) do not try to drain it yourself  since it may be located near a tear drainage duct
2909,sinus surgery balloon sinuplasty - minimally invasive technique  uses a small balloon inflated to widen blocked passages  generally has less bleeding and shorter recovery time endoscopic sinus surgery - uses a small camera to visually examined the sinuses tiny surgical instruments inserted to remove obstructive tissues  does not require any incision as the whole procedure is performed through the nostrils
2910,yes you can get pregnant however  you are at increased risk for another ectopic prgnancy or fertility issues associated to tubal disease
2911,could be sleep apnea but you need to see a doctor the internet is a great place to answer some questions like what is sleep apnea? or what is cheyne-stokes breathing? the internet not a good place to get a diagnosis that requires obtaining a complete history  a hands-on physical exam  maybe a sleep study or echocardiogram  etc  use the internet to get the questions to bring to your doctor  not the answers
2912,good numbers look good  continue healthy diet and excercise to keep them at ideal level
2913,probably not you need to see a doctor anytime you have numbness of any part of your body wisdom teeth usually cause pain and tightness-not numbness please seek medical attention
2914,no but your symptoms may be secondary to a vasculitis  dermatitis  diabetes  etc you need to see your pcp and undergo a complete medical evaluation
2915,one of the risks nerve damage is one of the risks of wisdom tooth extraction please see this site for more information http://wwwmayocliniccom/health/wisdom-tooth-extraction/my01212
2916,no a pap test looks for cervical cancer if you had a full hysterectomy  it means you don't have a cervix and therefore can't get cervical cancer and you don't need a pap test you will however need a pelvic exam  becuase that checks our pelvis and ovaries  which you will still have after a hysterectomy
2917,dissection? i would recommend seeing your doctor soon not enough info or exam to tell  but could be a vertebral dissection or narrowing of a blood vessel in back of head special imaging is needed to look for this  and complications can be devastating if gone undiagnosed  
2918,infection v allergy if this is acute  then most likely it's a viral infection if you have a history of allergy  then it could be cause if antihistamines don't help  it's probably a virus your doctor can tell you with more certainty with a physical exam
2919,see below your hdl is fine i would concentrate on lowering ldl to less than 120 diet  exercise  no smoking are the best would avoid statins at this point given your young age omega 3 won't hurt but probably not helpful as it will not lower ldl
2920,generally yes your case could be affected by several variables and you will need to review these with your surgeon make sure you are at a center where they are doing a lot of these and that your surgeon is very good ask them for specific numbers of cases just like yours
2921,need to see a doctor you need at least an x-ray to rule out any fracture and then determine what treatment is needed
2922,could be a few days this is a possible complication but usually the sensation of the lip and chin returns completely it can be as soon as a few days or as long as many weeks discuss these issues with your doctor at the 1 week follow up appointment most patients do fine
2923,also consider i agree with the other answers and suggest spry nasal spray which has been helpful to some of my patients
2924,you should visit a doctor and have it checked out at minimum  you likely should be wearing an ankle brace if you injure the ankle and it is unstable and you continue to walk on it you are not allowing it to heal properly
2925,splint not cast most physicians would likely apply a splint rather than a cast for a suspected fracture repeat xrays would likely be obtained a week later to confirm or exclude the possibility of fracture
2926,postop infection amoxicillin would be the first choice  unless you're allergic to penicillin other choices include clindamycin or keflex more importantly  have you contacted your oral surgeon or been back to see them? you should  if you haven't a postoperative wound infection can potentially be serious  and could lead to an abscess requiring an incision and drainage procedure  or even osteomyelitis see the doc
2927,myopic astigmatism your options include glasses  contact lenses  surface laser eye surgery  phakic intaocular lens implant  intracorneal ring segments  or orthokeratology the magnitude of your prescription would determine which options can be considered
2928,yes ganglion cysts on the top side (non-palm side) of the hand can be removed through an aspiration procedure this is a simple office procedure where a needle is introduced into the ganglion cyst and its contents are aspirated however  the risk of recurrence following an aspiration procedure is very high--as high as 75-80% consider the risks of recurrence when deciding on treatment options
2929,typically not a hole in the retina comes from traction from the vitreous (jelly) on the retina in the back portion of the eye during surgery  or the healing process from cataract surgery this traction may increase this can result in formation or progression of a hole in the retina typically one has a pre-disposing condition  complication  or traction for this to happen associated with cataract surgery
2930,huh? if you are not diabetic why are you measuring bg three times around your meal? you are asking for trouble stick with the standard method of diagnosis you are not at risk for organ damage until you become diabetic range and should not do anything other than eat a good mediterranean diet  maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly
2931,can try homeopathy pelvic pain and increased urinary frequency are classic bulk symptoms from fibroids there are some homeopathic medicines that can help but in my experience often the symptoms progress until something more definitive is needed depending the age  number of fibroids  desire for future fertility  she may need either myomectomy (surgical removal of the fibroids) or uterine artery embolization (uae)
2932,sometimes due to location of the nerve in the jaw this is sometimes a side effect of removing wisdom teeth their may or may not have been any way to avoid it
2933,probably not its not how long your period lasts but how long your cycles are that determines when you ovulate the average cycle (from the first day of menses to the next first day of menses) is 28 days ovulation occurs on the fourteenth day of the cycle so intercourse on the 7th day is not around ovulation if your cycle is 21 days  however  then ovulation occurs on day 7 and pregnancy is possible
2934,chest lesion bloody  pustular lesions on the chest wall in the midline rarely indicate breast cancer  notwithstanding your age and risk history  which you did not share you might have a msra abscess  which can linger for weeks  but if it persists  a visit to your dermatologist would be warranted
2935,may benefit a cast or a rigid walking boot may be used in such a situation
2936,yes very safe most women who have fibroids do not have symptoms (exs most commonly heavy menstrualbleeding  pelvic pain  increased urinary frequency) and therefore nothing is done about them we call these fibroids passangers as they ride along in the uterus until menopause and then start to die off no worries
2937,what to do? i agree with all of the other answers with a superficial clot  the value of compression is to decrease pain by decreasing inflammation you can also reduce inflammation with anti-inflammatory medicines  warm soaks  ice packs and leg elevation it is worth it to talk to your doctor about a lighter compression stocking too i would not recommend  however  an ace bandage they can make it worse
2938,mri knee sounds like you need to discuss it with your orthopedic surgeon it may or may not be a significant new tear there may be other issues of arthritis  etc that may be causing your pain
2939,that's a possibility it is possible that you have a clot i would get that checked out as the consequences of a clot can be serious
2940,possible not all kidney stones show up on x-ray if the pain is only at night it is not likely to be a stone you should see your doctor for a proper work-up
2941,possible hopefully  the area of numbness has been getting smaller over these 7 months if it has  that is favorable sometimes nerve damage occurs during lower wisdom tooth extraction and it can take quite a few months to resolve sometimes it doesn't but keep your fingers crossed as it often does
2942,no fixing the hernia is the primary problem and comes with its own set of risks one of the more common complications of hernia surgery is wound infection (albeit very rare) attempting to remove fat at the same operation would dramatically increase you risk of wound complications take care of you primary problem and  after your recovery  focus your attention on weight reduction
2943,dryness lasik can aggravate dry eye conditions dry eyes should be treated regardless if having lasik or not
2944,depends depending on how it is treated you can expect at least immobilazation or possible surgery
2945,depends it would be great if the answer was a definitive yes and  though the way you describe it  it seems likely  but it depends on the type of cancer  the extent of involvement  and the size of metastases also  if there are obscuring findings  like a diffuse pneumonia  it might be difficult to pick up on x-ray
2946,yes  yes  an enlarged ovary could be mistaken for a mass in the pelvis an ovarian cyst could be described as a low density structure which could be near the sigmoid colon  but without seeing the images it is impossible to know whether this is the case the best way to evaluate the ovaries is with transpelvic and/or transvaginal ultrasound it may be helpful to have your doctor discuss the findings with the radiologist the radiologist should be able to give some recommendations as to whether further evaluation with imaging such as pelvic ultrasound would be helpful or whether you should be referred directly to a surgical specialist
2947,similiar interstitial lung disease is an umbrella term for many diseases; one of these disease is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or ipf
2948,as as we age  the lens inside our eye undergoes change it becomes more cloudy and stiff the clouding of the lens is called a cataract  and most of us will need a cataract surgery when the lens becomes very cloudy affecting our daily activities this typically occurs in our 70's certain medical conditions and medications can make the progression of cataract faster now the stiffening of the lens occurs at early 40's and this process is called a presbyopia (a greek term for old vision) as the lens becomes more stiff  its ability to accomodate is lost this leads to difficulty focusing for objects that are close your distance vision should not be afftected most people use reading glasses for their presbyopia contact lenses for correcting presbyopia is not recommended since this will lead to blurry distance vision again  this need for reading glasses with presbyopia should have been explained by the surgeon prior to the lasik surgery
2949,astigmatism ; lasik lasik is a procedure that can definitely help patients with astigmatism  as long as the corneal topography shows a normal appearing cornea so - can see your own doctor and get evaluated to see if you are eligible for lasik
2950,chemoembolization chemoembolization is one of the many weapons we have to fight liver tumors advanced cirrhosis  hep c  and blood clotting problems are not in themselves contraindications for this procedure (although certain lab values such as bilirubin and inr/ platelets must be within a suitable range) you should discuss with an interventional oncologist to see whether it would be suitable for you
2951,treat cause the best way to make your dry eyes better is to find out the cause of your dry eye disease environmental exposure  decrease mucin   aqueous  lipid  pharmacologic  hormonal etc get an exam to determine the cause so you can get a customized treatment plan
2952,lasik i agree that lasik would be best
2953,very different some babies are born with cow's milk protein allergy which they may grow out of it can lead to blood in the stool  fussiness (gerd) or rash some with cows mp allergy also have soy allergy which means no milk intake for mom when nursing or a special formula for baby lactose intolerance happens later and is due to poor gut absorption of milk it can lead to gassiness and loose stool
2954,yes this would be very unusual but not impossible  and would raise the suspicion of an unusual type of cancer at that age
2955,nope don't worry stds are caused by germs passed from one person to another having sex doesn't create stds if neither partner has an std before sex occurs  neither one can get an std of course if either person has had sex with someone else  he or she might bring an std into the relationship that can happen without knowing the std was there this is the only way stds sometimes appear in monogamous couples
2956,short answer no losing your uterus at such a young age will likely have negative consequences which are completely avoidable by undergoing uterine fibroid embolization (ufe) instead your uterus is important to you psychologically  sexually  and there is increased osteoporosis and heart disease risks with hysterectomy i'd find an interventiomal radiologist with particular experience in ufe and keep your parts!
2957,perhaps corneal abrasion at the time of cataract surgery can happen  but it is very rare certain conditions can increase the incidence (dry eyes  blepharitis  even previous lasik) the retinal swelling also is somewhat rare to the level you are describing  but it too still happens conditions like diabetes  uveitis history  and pre-existing wrinkling of the retina (epiretinal membrane) increase risk
2958,bone chip because you state you have a bone chip i will assume you have had x rays taken if the chip is in a position to hurt you speak to your podiatrist who will guide you in making the decision that is right for you good luck !
2959,both do both lasik and prk will treat myopia and astigmatism
2960,yes new intraocular lens designs can correct both astigmatism and nearsightedness  allowing for the possibility of excellent uncorrected distance vision your ophthalmologist can determine if you are a candidate for this type of premium lens implant
2961,osa yes  it can create irritability  depression like symptoms  poor concentration  poor memory and many others
2962,see a doctor go to a local medical clinic and have the doctor evaluate the nodes  better safe than sorry
2963,viral illness lymph node enlargement differential diagnosis (ddx) is large  but likely an acute viral illness -- eg influenza if not improved soon see a doctor for ddx see table 3 especially - lad a-z http://wwwmathenyinfo/files/habermann_mayo_clin_proc_2000_75_723pdf
2964,classic classic carpal tunnel syndrome see if a wrist splint helps you sleep at night if you still get numb with the splint on or if you are a little numb all the time  it's time to see a hand surgeon carpal tunnel syndrome can be cured with surgery if we get to it prior to advanced nerve damage
2965,unless unless you are experienced reading ultrasounds  wait for the radiologist to review and interpret it for you
2966,testing can prove if you have symptoms due to peripheral neuropathy  an emg-nerve conduction test should be abnormal unless it is a small fiber neuropathy  which can be confirmed under the microscope if you have ms  mri of head and/or spinal cord could confirm diagnosis  but spinal fluid studies often can doubly confirm suspicions blood and urine studies can rule out other diseases which mimic ms
2967,don't delay in getting evaluatedconsider er
2968,get it looked at the ingrown part of the nail is not always visible try soaking your foot in warm water  removal of embedded debris from the nail borders  and applying an antibiotic ointment to temporarily soften the corners if you have redness and drainage  get it looked at by a professional  as you may need to have the ingrown nail border removed you may need antibiotics
2969,chicken pox water filled bumps sound like chicken pox until proven otherwise
2970,drip may not be the sinuses could be a sign of silent acid reflux also called lpr one of its symptoms is a drip and nausea see an ent to look at the larynx or voice box to see of there are signs it it you may need to see a gi
2971,yes most breast cancers are first treated with surgery after breast-conserving surgery  radiation is necessary not all breast cancers need treatment with chemotherapy if a breast cancer is estrogen sensitive  it can often be treated with an oral medication that blocks estrogen instead of chemotherapy
2972,muscle spasm trigger points are bands of taut muscle areas that hurt when pressed upon and radiate to other areas than just the painful spot that is pressed upon most times stretching and massage of that area relieves these spots  however sometime they continue and need to be addressed by your doctor if this doesn't resolve it or touch doesn't hurt  consider this being sciatica and get spine evaluation
2973,yes if the disease is limited and original colon cancer addressed focal intense radiation called radiosurgery can be very effective if there is significant disease then standard radiation can be used to help symptoms
2974,no! no! remember doctors can not diagnose over the phone or internet  but is the 'stye' you describe a painful bump in your eyelid? --if so the treatment is not a steroid (so no hydrocortisone) a stye is a 'blocked gland' in your eyelid (it's a mechanical problem) the general treatment is: -warm compressess -anti-biotic eye drop or ointment and if not improved : a small surgical procedure by an ophthomologist hope you're better soon
2975,thin chest wall if he has a thin chest well he may be feeling his heart hitting up against his chest wall like a ping pong ball nothing serious
2976,absolutely lymph nodes should be checked by a doctor and not on the internet
2977,not unless sensitive best management of a uti is for dr to get urine sample for culture & sensitivities before antiantibiotics are taken patient can start antibiotics as soon as sample is taken result will be ready in 48 hrs and show which antibiotics will be effective against bacteria causing your uti if bacteria are resistant  as yours are  an appropriate antibiotic can be selected  usually not amoxil
2978,no the risk to the transplanted lungs are infection from bacteria left over from the old lungs  and acute and chronic rejection of the new lung by the body cystic fibrosis is a defect that is limited to the old lungs
2979,i i think it's time for a second opinion you're incredibly young to have all this going on in your foot & ankle  and i would also get an mri to see exactly where the tears and damage is i would strongly discourage you from any exploratory surgery in an effort to fix what's wrong i would get an accurate diagnosis first i'm also concerned about those cortisone injections you were getting for a stress fracture i've never heard of giving cortisone for a stress fracture in fact  quite the contrary  steroids tend to delay healing of fractures  and they come with the risk of tendon rupture  which you apparently had please get a second opinion before proceeding any further preferably with either a foot & ankle orthopedist or a podiatrist certified in foot & ankle surgery by the american board of podiatric surgery good luck!
2980,varies there are a number of potential causes  but among the most common is plantar fasciitis  which can usually be diagnosed by an examination and will usually respond to stretching  an orthotic  or sometimes a cortisone shot  don't hesitate to be seen
2981,blepharospasm u having had lasik does not preclude you from having blepharoplasty the dryness could be an issue have your eyes evaluated by a board certified surgeon with expertise in eyelid surgery
2982,an infection use antibiotic ointment and a yeast prep--if not better see a drthis is unlikely to be an std
2983,if if you are over the age of 12  your vision from the lazy eye will not improve that is why it is important for a child to have a early vision screening and if a treatment is needed that it is followed through now  if you are talking about being crossed eye then there is a surgery to correct this
2984,? molluscum there are many possibilities  but one that fits your description might be molluscum contagiosum this is a viral infection of the skin you should see a health professional for further evaluation
2985,cystoscopy the next reasonable step in your care is cystoscopy under anesthesia you will need biopsies and/or transurethral resection of the mass discovered
2986,many possibilities your pain could be as a result of many different things causes of pain may include: trauma (fracture  sprain  arthritis)  infection (ingrown nail)  metabolic conditions (gout)  musculoskeletal or biomechanical abnormality and neurologic conditions (neuropathy) a thorough history and physical exam and possibly some laboratory and radiology exams are needed to determine the exact cause
2987,certain certain local anesthetics can have a duration of action of 6 to 8 hours depending on the site of injection these long acting anesthetics are routinely used in third molar surgery to provide extended relief from surgical pain if the anesthesia remains the morning after the surgery it may indicate that the nerve in the area may have been disturbed this is a known consequence associated with the removal of the lower third molars and can result from stretching  compressing or tearing of the nerve stretching and compression injuries have better prognosis for recovery  though it may take several months for full sensation to return thought injuries typically do not require further treatment  just monitoring injuries that involve transection of the nerve can be permanent it is these types of injuries that may require further surgical treatment no matter the cause  prolonged anesthesia  greater than a day  require follow-up by the treating surgeon
2988,treating treating lazy eye or amblyopia requires a lot of motivation on both the part of the parents and child early intervention makes improvement possible - improvement in vision is the goal and if it does not occur by age 9  it likely will not improve when i see older individuals with a history of lazy eye that has improved  i remind them how lucky they are that it did improve and how lucky they were to have to have motivated parents and eye doctors

3256,see your doctor probably not cancer  but need further workup much more likely an anal fissure or hemorrhoids related to constipation/low fiber diet please see your doctor fora complete history and physical depending on that workup  further evaluation by a general surgeon or gastroenterologist may be appropriate colonoscopy may be indicated
3257,possibly a pregnancy test can most likely answer for you they can be obtained at a drugstore or market they are not 100%  so if your symptoms stay  you may want recheck in another week
3258,i agree with the other doctors comments i would add though that the peak of swelling is usually 72 hours post surgery  so your tennis ball may even get larger once swelling presents  it is difficult to modify this ice for the first 48 hours & then on third day moist heat application to help reduce swelling a tennis ball size swelling is a bit excessive though motrin 800mg  & narcotic for pain - & time
3259,difficult to say there are many causes of anemia a full work up is really required to see what is the cause colon cancer causes anemia by slow blood loss in the stool a test for microscopic blood in the stool will help your doctor decide if there is cause to re-evaluate for colon cancer the type of polyp is also important as to how frequently screening for cancer needs to be performed
3260,not related gbm is not caused by stress if it were  gbm would be a lot more common than it is chronic stress  or reactions to it  can cause or be associated with a bunch of other health issues learn to destress  preferably without meds  or drugs like alcohol  pot  etc
3261,no why are you worried about the cremasteric response ? the muscle is not cut out during surgery it is spread apart to expose the sac and cord structures
3262,see below to find out if you're pregnant or not  try to do over-the counter pregnancy test for your peace of mind  you might want to contact either your primary care physician or obgyn some things just cannot be diagnosed and addressed over the internet :) good luck!
3263,no chest x-ray can diagnose some lung conditions  but not others much more information is needed to even start answering this question age? industrial exposures? emotional issues? findings on physical exam? more tests may be necessary  such as pulmonary function studies  and others the diagnosis for this complaint can range from asthma to pulmonary fibrosis (unusual) to anxiety (most common)
3264,various the usual warning signs of a pulmonary embolism (pe) include tachycardia (fast heart rate)  dyspnea (shortness of breath)  chest pain which can be pleuritic (ie hurts when you take a deep breath)  fainting (known as syncope) and cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips or nailbeds)
3265,paresthesia your paresthesia could be related to nerve damage during the procedure  some inflammation and swelling still present  or an infection not completely resolved the longer the paresthesia lasts  the less the chance of full recovery the good news is that it's still relatively early in the time range that would allow full recovery this should be monitored very closely see comment->
3266,arteriosclerosis you are taking hydrocodone  tramadol & lyrica for nagging pain plus ambien for sleep and buspirone for anxiety combination is heavy stuff had migraine but not any more? microvascular disease is the blockage of tiny vessels-arteriosclerosis these can happen in heart & kidney as well check your lipid profile and possible use of statin for headache & reevaluation of all your meds see neurologist
3267,uterine mass did he take a biopsy of the mass? the only way to really know is to biopsy it otherwise  it's a matter of guess
3268,he would know neurologists r the diagnosers & treaters 4 ms?
3269,relaxation response when you get the panic attack try to create a thought record with what thought triggered that emotion by working through your fears you can help process the stress simple technique like letting go medication - while inhale say let and exhale say go and will be able to watch your breathing and regulate your emotions sometimes irregular heartbeats can mimic panic supplement with magnesium oratate
3270,further evaluation with a specialist to help identify possible causes of your abdominal pain  since the other tests you listed are normal may recommend endoscopy with biopsies to evaluate stomach for bacterial infection  gastritis  ulcers  etc
3271,unlikely if you have no gallstones and your common bile duct is the normal size  then it's probably not your gallbladder a small liver cyst is likely to be incidental  and probably wouldn't cause your symptoms either go to see your local gastroenterologist for a further evaluation
3272,rinse mouth you can rinse your mouth each time you eat when i had mine removed  i never had to use syringe to remove food of course  to minimize the discomfort  try to chew on the healthy side more until it heals
3273,low risk for cancer your worry is understandable and made worse by financial concerns check your local area for cash prices  non-insurance clinics and free health clinics you will benefit from a doctors care  a good gp check out the bowel regimens for chronic constipation on healthtap
3274,yes sciatica can cause pain in the described areas sciatica or radicular pain may be differentiated from other conditions that cause pain in these areas as the pain travels along the course of a known nerve (dermatomal pattern) based on spinal fusion history noted in your profile  this is likely lumbosacral radiculopathy (a form of sciatica)
3275,not always random glucose fluctuates the more accurate blood test is the hemoglobin a1c which gives an average level over a period of weeks/months still it's good news that you had so many normal results
3276,certainly have you been checked for sleep apnea yet? set up an appointment to see a sleep specialist
3277,may be unrelated the initial bad taste after the extraction may have been a dry socket  food debris  or bacteria caught in the socket unpleasant breath may be caused by other factors  including cavities  gastric reflux  and your diet all these potential causes need to be explored  since brushing and gargling will only temporarily mask the problem all the best
3278,why put in? the answer somewhat depends on the cause of the collapsed lung and the method the tube was inserted  how long ago  and if the red color is getting better or worse
3279,about cranberry cranberry juice and extract is able to decrease urine infections with e coli bacteria b/c it interferes with the bacteria's mechanism for sticking to the bladder wall and 'climbing' up into the urinary tract there are many other bacteria that cause urine infection  however  and cranberry has no effect on them without a urine culture  you will not know which type of bacteria are causing uti
3280,electrophysiology ask you doctor: do you need electrophysiology study
3281,lens options there are 3 key options for cataract surgery: monofocal (give you ability to see 1 distance); multifocal (see multiple distances but risk of glare/halos); accommodative lenses (allow multiple distances; less risk of glare; but may not work as well for reading vision especially over time) more info: eyedoc2020@blogspotcom visionary ophthalmology  rockville  md
3282,growth factors your oncologist can use bone marrow growth factors (gcsf) to stimulate production of white blood cells these drugs  developed and tested in the 1980's  became available in the ~spring of 1991 and (along with drugs to treat/prevent nausea) completely changed the field of oncology it went from being a mostly inpatient discipline  to one almost entirely practiced in the outpatient setting
3283,blurry it will leave the vision blurry until it is removed depending on the condition of the retina
3284,see your md looks like you have degenerative changes to your lumbar spine there are many non-surgical treatment options see your physician to discuss these you may also want to be refered to a spine specialist
3285,possible but quite small hard to biopsy at that size full history  and complete exam necessary repeat ct 3 months if change-then open biopsy
3286,a low back nerve impingement could do this  a hallux limitus type of deformity as well as gout  sesamoiditis  fracture amongst common ones 
3287,did you get help for your sleep apnea issues  by treating your sleep apnea you feel much better
3288,many possibilities the recent staph infection may or may not be related to your current abdominal symptoms ask for an ultrasound of your gallbladder  to look for gallstones when you get in with your primary good luck
3289,pimple or lump a pimple is like 1 u may develop anywhere  red  often white center itchy or sore and involves superficial skin layers a lump 2 worry about is pain free  well below the skin not red if really worried  c ur gyn 2 b sure or a dermatologist
3290,see your family doc it sounds more gastric or esophageal to me see your family doctor and have appropriate tests run  a ct scan of your coronary arteries is a non- invasive way to check your coronary arteries also  a gi doc can check you for gastric and esophageal causes i would also add in sleep apnea into the differential diagnosis due to skipped beats  anxiety or depression insomnia and daytime tiredness good luck to you
3291,yes it is certainly possible that you have gastritis due to the anti-inflammatory that you've been taking daily stop the naproxen  and see your doctor to make sure that you don't have any evidence of gastric bleeding continue the protonix and zantac
3292,yes  quite common it sounds like you have uncomplicated diverticulitis  which is most often treated as outpatient with oral antibiotics  often cipro and flagyl most people get better; most (about 65%) won't have any more episodes for those who do have another episode  99% are less serious than the first one after the acute episode is over  make sure to drink enough water (64 oz/day) and add a fiber supplement
3293,many there are many lasers: noninvasive and invasive noninvasive lasers help with discolorations (ipl  ktp  nd:yag  alex  ruby  pulsed dye  diode) or collagen remodeling (thermage  titan) invasive lasers include co2  fractional co2 (activefx  deepfx  totalfx  repair)  erbium  fraxel  ematrix
3294,no usually will not affect your sexual drive
3295,see a neurologist if the headaches are severe and episodic  you could be having migraines this in particular  if there are visual symptoms such as flashing like or if there is sensitivity to light a neurologist should be able to help to diagnosis and treat this you may also need additional brain imaging studies like an mri scan depending on what the neurologist finds on your physical exam and history
3296,torn ankle ligament at least for 2-3 weeks in a camwalker
3297,gynecology not sure what led you to a heart work up first and not a gynecology work up and/or a hysterectomy but  this surely seems like something you should approach your gynecologist about
3298,this needs diagnosis need to tie this down first  get aquaporin-4 study for neuromyelitis optica  and also visual evoked potential which is twice as accurate as mri yes  it could very well be ms  and you should get spinal fluid and check oligoclonal bands  but send fluid to mayo clinic  not locally lastly  get a second opinion asap ms drugs will make worse if nmo other problems should be excluded
3299,ankle pain i might suggest you see a sports medicine orthopod that specialist would determine what course to take ie bloodwork  x-ray  cat scan  and/or mri that being said i am a psychiatrist and just suggesting what i would tell a family member if they called me with your question
3300,hormone no period for 2 months in a person your age is usually pregnancy until proven otherwise once you have confirmed a negative pregnancy test  you will need an exam to really assess the symptoms your doctor will look for possible ovarian cyst  or other probable hormonal imbalance that might easily be remedied by the way  any new food or supplements? consider all over the counter meds or vitamins
3301,probably not if there is no nodule seen on the most recent exam then there is really nothing to follow up thyroid is a superficial organ so it's easily scanned with an ultrasound and if there is a nodule its easy to pick up you can always talk to the radiologist who read your ultrasound if you are still concerned
3302,sob during sleep dysautonomia is hard to link to shortness of breath that awakens you from sleep do you have asthma/ reactive airway disease  obstructive sleep apnea  or environmental allergies? perhaps  ask your doctor about ruling out these breathing conditions  or consult a pulmonologist meanwhile  try sleeping on your side or stomach rather than your back good luck!
3303,suggest see md now i suggest you seek medical attention right away this does not sound like only a simple bee sting reaction
3304,it depends if the lesion is suspicious for malignancy by mri  your doctor most likely will schedule a biopsy the pathologist who reads the biopsy will decide the cell type that is there if the cell type is melanoma  then it will be considered a metastasis many other different cell types can be seen in liver biopsies if it is a new cell type (carcinoma  lymphoma  or sarcoma)  it would be a new cancer
3305,possible it's possible that there could be a fracture you may need to clinical evaluated and need imaging (x-rays) to determine if there is a fracture and get treatment good luck
3306,not cancer both nodules sound perfectly benign by their histologic description sonographic (ultrasound) follow-up is recommended in 12 months to ensure stability
3307,staph infection maybe i don't get it  but a pus filled sore needs immediate medical attention what are you doing staying away from the doctor? don't you see the daily news stories of people dying from staph infections?
3308,medication effects do not recommend use of risperdal in this situation  as there is a substantial risk of stroke or death  in those elderly folks who have dementia of course  i fully agree that the weight gain and fatigue is also due to this drug is there are major issue with stopping it in view of all the potential problems? is her diagnosis confirmed  such as alzheimer's? should you get a second opinion?
3309,see a doctor you need to be seen by a physician to be evaluated you may have a urinary tract infection  epididymitis  prostatitis it sounds like you are already being treated with cipro and levaquin?
3310,may be he has the symptoms plus other cold symptoms like runny nose and sneezing a rapid strep test at your pediatrician office will help confirm the diagnosis
3311,possibly the presence of hormonally active ovarian cysts can definitely have an effect on your cycle if you period is absent  then you must check a pregnancy test the workup would also include tests of thyroid function and measures of other hormones
3312,go back hopefully it is not cancer but if it is  the earlier it is diagnosed  the better your chance for cure also - and importantly - the side effects of treatment are much worse for advanced head and neck cancer and the recurrence rate after treatment is much worse when it is advanced if it is cancer - it won't go away and it will make you miserable without treatment get it checked!
3313,immune dysfunction! jra (also called jia) for juvenille idiopathic arthritis is a disease of unknown etiology there are many theories for why it happens  many believe there is a virus responsible the damage to the joints  pain and stiffness is due to an inappropriate immune response which results in the immune system attacking tissues of the host (patient) rheumatologists can provide appropriate dx and rx
3314,get an mri mri of the breast can pick up otherwise hidden cancers if still no primary in the breast  it can be left intact and radiated instead of mastectomy
3315,you need to see an orthopedist how do you know there is no fracture? if you know because you went to a doctor  then what did they tell you? just because you walk does not mean there is no fracture patellar tendonitis can be very painful as well a proper exam is warranted  particularly with that much pain i would ice it until being able to be seen
3316,viral illness it sure does sound like a viral illness  although  i can be mistaken  too
3317,possible persistent breast lumps  regardless of age  should be aggressively evaluated see your primary physician for referral to a surgeon  a breast center for mammogram and possible ultrasound with biopsy if required no more waiting- get acting
3318,overaeration abnormal chest x-ray findings are usually not seen until copd is severe x-ray may show flattening of diaphragms  large muscle that separates lungs and heart from the abdominal cavity and increased size of the chest  as measured from front to backabnormal air collections within the lung (focal bullae) however definite copd requires pulmonary function testingxray findings alone not diagnostic
3319,tests you've had more than enough testing if you're concerned about your heart disease future use a mediterranean or vegetarian diet and get regular daily aerobic and some weight exercise keep your high bp controlled to normal and be sure your blood sugar and lipids are controlled you're fine now doing those things will help keep it that way
3320,emergency sounds an emergency that you should not sit on it i wuld discuss with my physician on call person now or go to emergency room/urgent care
3321,overaeration abnormal chest x-ray findings are usually not seen until copd is severe in this case  x-ray may show: flattening of diaphragms  the large muscle that separates lungs and heart from the abdominal cavityincreased size of the chest  as measured from front to back abnormal air collections within the lung (focal bullae)
3322,need evaluation likely hemorrhoids but better get the evaluation
3323,er go to the er you need to be seen and get some fluids
3324,yes your symptoms may represent what we call radiculopathy this occurs as a result of your nerves being pinched as they exit the spine by your protruding disc and osteophytes you may benefit from an injection of steroid into the area of pressure of the nerve which may help your symptoms consult a physiatrist or spine specialist
3325,unclear the symptoms which you describe are quite consistent with many diagnoses pregnancy is one of many possible things that could be going on if you think you are pregnant  then you should start by determining when was your last period if it is late  then that could be the first indication you might be pregnant the best way to tell if you are pregnant is to undergo a pregnancy test
3326,we need imaging you have imaging which you need to share this could be arthritis  tendonitis or another soft tissue syndrome  your description sounds like you have contractures a rheumatologist can help guide you to answer
3327,vaginitis the most common cause is yeast infection  trichomonas and bacterial std infection s are gc  chlamidia  syphilis  herpes  etc
3328,see below either you are going to soon break with shingles or you have thoracic radiculopathy( pinched nerve off your thoracic spine)---see your doctor for further evaluation
3329,sometimes about 60 million americans experience chronic sleep deprivation there are several long term health consequences associated with serious sleep deprivation  including increased risk for hypertension  diabetes  weight gain  depression  and accidents have you tried reading literature on diet  exercise  sleep hygiene  meditation  etc  for your anxiety and sleep? good luck!
3330,yes get checked
3331,very high rates depend on what you are defining as success hip replacement is more than 90% successful in reducing or eliminating pain depending on your mother's activity level and desired activities  some changes may need to be made but her orthopedic surgeon could talk to her about this before the surgery and be more specific
3332,consider trying a nasal steroid like flonase at night it may be all allergies if used at night the steroid makes your post nasal drip into an antiinflammatory a nettie pot will help as well get this better and see how everything else goes good luck
3333,see below a physical therapist can teach you exercises to stretch the thigh's quadriceps and hamstrings  which may help reduce the tension on the spot where the kneecap's tendon attaches to the shinbone strengthening exercises for the quadriceps can help stabilize the knee jointosgood-schlatter disease usually gets better without formal treatment symptoms typically disappear after your bones stop growing
3334,sore throat many sore throat  runny nose and cough are from a viral infection it just need to run it's course of 7-10 days antibiotic will do nothing and can be the cause of upset stomach bed rest  hydration and otc cold and cough medicine will help you
3335,go for it unless specifically restricted by your ophthalmologist or retina specialist lattice degeneration should not limit vigorous exercise the vitamins and supplements you mentioned do not affect lattice one way or another
3336,no  but no you should not worry especially  but do know that about 7% of patients with lattice will get a retinal detachment at some point in their life high myopia is another risk factor that adds to your risk since you are the adventurous type  you may want to consider laser treatment of the lattice to protect you from potential retinal detachment occurring in an area without proper care
3337,? anxiety these behaviors can be related to anxiety and other psychiatric disease go see a psychiatrist or psychologist for further evaluation
3338,palliative care treatment for stage 4 cancer is mainly palliative  menaing to improve symptoms and hopefully to prolong life based on your age  your mom is probably in her late 70s or 80's with her on home oxygen because of diffuse lung metsand at her advanced age  we should be careful and realistic about her treatment you and mom should have a thorough discussion with her oncologist about his goal for her
3339,infection vs other lymph nodes in neck could be due to scalp infection but need a thorough exam  blood test to r/o infection vs hodgkin's disease status of other lymph nodes-axilla  groin etc?
